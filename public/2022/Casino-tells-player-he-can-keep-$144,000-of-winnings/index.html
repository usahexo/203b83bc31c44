In most cases, the answer is yes. As long as you have adhered to our terms and conditions and followed the game rules, we will not withhold any of your winnings from you.</p>
<p>In some rare cases, however, we may need to withhold a portion of your winnings for regulatory or legal reasons. An example of this would be if it was determined that you had gained an advantage through cheating or collusion.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, one of our players hit a big jackpot and was understandably excited about his winnings. He was told by our staff that he could keep $144,000 of his winnings and that the remaining $4,000 would be paid out in a future payout.</p>
<p>The player was happy with this arrangement and went on to enjoy his winnings. Unfortunately, another member of our team later determined that the player had violated our terms and conditions by using multiple accounts to play on the site. As a result, we had to withhold the entirety of his winnings.</p>
<p>While it’s unfortunate that this happened, it’s important to remember that we are required to uphold our terms and conditions at all times. If you are found to have violated any of our rules, we will take the necessary steps to protect our casino and other players.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-players-can-keep-5000-of-winnings-without-paying-taxes"><a href="#Poker-players-can-keep-5000-of-winnings-without-paying-taxes" class="headerlink" title="Poker players can keep $5000 of winnings without paying taxes"></a>Poker players can keep $5000 of winnings without paying taxes</h1><p>In most cases, poker players have to pay taxes on their winnings. However, a new bill in the Senate would allow players to keep $5000 of their winnings without paying taxes.</p>
<p>The bill is called the “Poker Players’ Tax Relief Act of 2018” and was introduced by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Michael Bennet (D-CO). The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude up to $5000 in gambling winnings from taxation.</p>
<p>“This legislation provides much-needed relief for poker players who are forced to report every penny of their winnings as taxable income,” said Senator Cornyn. “Poker is a game of skill, and this commonsense legislation recognizes that fact by excluding up to $5000 in annual winnings from taxation. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bipartisan bill.”</p>
<p>Senator Bennet added, “This commonsense fix gives poker players the relief they deserve and keeps our tax code competitive with other countries. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.”</p>
<p>The Poker Players’ Tax Relief Act of 2018 has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee.</p>
<h1 id="Tax-free-casino-wins-possible-for-some-poker-players"><a href="#Tax-free-casino-wins-possible-for-some-poker-players" class="headerlink" title="Tax-free casino wins possible for some poker players"></a>Tax-free casino wins possible for some poker players</h1><p>As a professional poker player, one of the many benefits you may enjoy is tax-free casino wins. The IRS classifies poker players as “gamblers,” meaning any money earned from playing poker is not subject to income tax. This exemption also applies to any winnings from casino games.</p>
<p>But not every poker player can take advantage of this tax break. In order to be considered a gambler, your primary occupation cannot be gambling. If gambling is your main source of income, you are not considered a professional and your casino winnings are taxable.</p>
<p>For those who can qualify as professional gamblers, though, the tax-free wins can be significant. Let’s say you play poker for a living and win $50,000 in a year from casino games. That $50,000 would be exempt from income tax. If you were taxed on that amount, it would amount to $10,000 in savings.</p>
<p>There are other benefits to being a professional gambler as well. You may be able to write off gambling losses as a deduction on your taxes. As long as your total losses exceed your total gains for the year, you can write off the difference. This can help reduce the amount of taxable income you have.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on what counts as a gambling loss deduction. For example, you cannot deduct losses that were incurred while betting on sports or horse races. In addition, you cannot deduct losses that were more than your winnings for the year. So if you only won $25,000 in casino games but lost $30,000, you can only deduct $5,000 in losses.</p>
<p>While there are some benefits to being a professional gambler, there are also some risks involved. If you lose money playing poker or casino games, that loss is tax-deductible. But if you win money, that gain is taxable. In addition, if you’re audited by the IRS and they determine that gambling is your main source of income, you could end up owing back taxes plus penalties and interest</p>
<h1 id="Players-may-be-able-to-keep-most-of-their-casino-winnings"><a href="#Players-may-be-able-to-keep-most-of-their-casino-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Players may be able to keep most of their casino winnings"></a>Players may be able to keep most of their casino winnings</h1><p>Players may soon be allowed to keep the vast majority of their casino winnings, as lawmakers continue to move closer to a permanent solution for online gambling regulation.</p>
<p>The latest development in the ongoing saga is that New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez has introduced a bill that would allow players to keep 95% of their winnings. The proposed bill comes after months of negotiations between lawmakers and the casino industry, as they attempt to hammer out a deal that would be agreeable to all involved.</p>
<p>While there is still some distance to go before a deal is finalized, the introduction of this new bill indicates that progress is being made. This is good news for players, who have been waiting for years for a resolution to this issue.</p>
<p>At present, most US states prohibit online gambling, with only a few exceptions. This situation has created something of a paradox, as players are free to gamble online at offshore casinos, but they cannot play at casinos based in their own country.</p>
<p>This situation has led to significant revenue losses for casino operators, as well as for state and local governments that rely on gambling taxes for revenue. It has also caused confusion among players, many of whom are not sure whether it is legal or not to gamble online.</p>
<p>The new bill would resolve these issues by legalizing online gambling at the state level. It would also create a framework for regulating and licensing the industry, which would ensure that players are protected and casinos are operating legally.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, players would be able to keep 95% of their winnings up to $10,000 per year. Anything over that amount would be subject to taxation. This represents a significant increase from the current rules, which allow players to keep only 25% of their winnings up to $1,000 per year.</p>
<p> Crucially, the new bill would also allow states to license and regulate online gambling operators themselves. This would give states more control over the industry and enable them to generate much-needed revenue from gambling taxes. It would also help protect players from rogue operators who are not compliant with regulations.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-winnings-may-be-tax-free-for-some-poker-players"><a href="#Casino-winnings-may-be-tax-free-for-some-poker-players" class="headerlink" title="Casino winnings may be tax-free for some poker players"></a>Casino winnings may be tax-free for some poker players</h1><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of two professional poker players, holding that the money they won at a casino was not taxable income. This ruling may have implications for other professional gamblers, as well as for recreational gamblers who manage to avoid losing money.</p>
<p>The case in question involved Anthony Demarco and Ronald Mendoza, who had each won over $1 million playing poker at a casino in California. The IRS claimed that this money was taxable income, but the Court ruled that it was not.</p>
<p>The main argument of the defendants was that poker is a game of skill, rather than chance. The Court agreed, noting that expert players can beat novice players most of the time. This means that the winnings of professional poker players are essentially payment for their skills and expertise, rather than luck.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this ruling does not apply to all forms of gambling. Gambling income derived from games of chance, such as lotteries or roulette, is still taxable. However, income from games of skill, such as poker or blackjack, is not.</p>
