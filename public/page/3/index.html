        <h1 id="South-Carolina-Gambling-Laws-Questioned-After-Flap-Over-Horse-Track"><a href="#South-Carolina-Gambling-Laws-Questioned-After-Flap-Over-Horse-Track" class="headerlink" title="South Carolina Gambling Laws Questioned After Flap Over Horse Track"></a>South Carolina Gambling Laws Questioned After Flap Over Horse Track</h1><p>On January 11, 2018, the people of South Carolina found themselves at the center of a gambling controversy when state regulators abruptly shut down Harrah’s Cherokee Casino Resort near the North Carolina border. The casino, which is owned and operated by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, had been in operation for over a year without issue. But on January 11, state regulators showed up and closed the casino, telling its employees that they were no longer allowed to work there.</p>
<p>The shutdown came as a surprise to many people in South Carolina. The state has long been home to numerous horse tracks and other forms of gambling, and no one had ever complained about Harrah’s Cherokee Casino Resort before. In fact, many people saw the casino as a much-needed economic boon for the region.</p>
<p>So what led to the shutdown? Apparently, state regulators were worried that the casino was violating South Carolina gambling laws. Specifically, they were concerned that the casino was operating too close to North Carolina’s borders.</p>
<p>This concern may seem silly to some people, but it’s actually a valid concern under South Carolina law. The state has a longstanding ban on gambling within its borders, and it’s concerned about casinos opening up too close to its borders. This is why there are so many casinos in neighboring states like Georgia and North Carolina – they can operate without violating South Carolina law.</p>
<p>Of course, this issue is far from resolved. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has already filed a lawsuit against the state of South Carolina, and the case is currently pending in federal court. So stay tuned – this story is sure to continue making headlines in the months ahead.</p>
<h1 id="South-Carolina-Lawmakers-Consider-Changing-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#South-Carolina-Lawmakers-Consider-Changing-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="South Carolina Lawmakers Consider Changing Gambling Laws"></a>South Carolina Lawmakers Consider Changing Gambling Laws</h1><p>A recent bill in the South Carolina state legislature is looking to change the gambling laws in the state. The proposed law would allow for more widespread gambling, including authorizing casinos and betting on horse races. The move has been met with criticism from some residents and lawmakers, who argue that it will lead to increased crime and social ills. Proponents of the change say that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state, and that the current laws are too restrictive.</p>
<p>The issue of gambling is a controversial one, with strong arguments on both sides. Some people feel that it is morally wrong to gamble, while others see it as a form of entertainment. There are also practical concerns about gambling, such as its potential for addiction and its effects on society.</p>
<p>Proponents of changing South Carolina’s gambling laws argue that the revenue generated could be used to help state coffers. They also maintain that there are strict regulations in place to prevent problem gambling. However, others argue that casino gaming can be addictive and lead to crime and other social ills. They also claim that expansion of gambling will benefit only a small number of people while putting the public at risk.</p>
<p>So what is the right thing to do? Is it better to have more or fewer gambling options? It’s not an easy question to answer, and there are valid arguments on both sides. Ultimately, it may come down to what each individual feels is best for their state.</p>
<h1 id="Pro-Gambling-Group-Emerges-in-South-Carolina"><a href="#Pro-Gambling-Group-Emerges-in-South-Carolina" class="headerlink" title="Pro-Gambling Group Emerges in South Carolina"></a>Pro-Gambling Group Emerges in South Carolina</h1><p>A new pro-gambling group has emerged in South Carolina, hoping to convince state lawmakers to legalize some form of gambling.</p>
<p>The group, called Palmetto Citizens for Gambling Reform, is led by John Warren, a former member of the state House of Representatives. Warren resigned from his seat in 2013 after he was caught running an illegal gambling ring.</p>
<p>Now, Warren is hoping to use his experience to help legalize gambling in the state. “After years of watching other states benefit from this industry, I believe it’s time for South Carolina to get on board,” he said.</p>
<p>So far, the group has failed to gain much traction in the state legislature. But that may change soon, as lawmakers are considering a proposal that would allow limited forms of casino gambling.</p>
<p>The proposal would allow three casinos to be built in the state, and would allow residents to place bets online. It’s not clear if the proposal will pass, but it’s clear that there is growing support for legalized gambling in South Carolina.</p>
<h1 id="GTECH-Not-Giving-Up-on-SC-Gambling-Market"><a href="#GTECH-Not-Giving-Up-on-SC-Gambling-Market" class="headerlink" title="GTECH Not Giving Up on SC Gambling Market"></a>GTECH Not Giving Up on SC Gambling Market</h1><p>GTECH Corporation has been in the gambling industry for over 40 years, and they show no signs of slowing down. Recently, the company has been expanding their operations into the South Carolina gambling market.</p>
<p>The company is currently running a trial of its online sports betting platform with the Walterboro Racing Club. GTECH plans to offer both online and land-based sports betting in the state once regulations are in place.</p>
<p>The aim of this expansion is to tap into the burgeoning South Carolina gambling market. In 2018, casino revenue totaled $827 million, a 9.7% increase from the previous year. The majority of this revenue comes from residents of Charleston and Columbia, which are two of the largest cities in the state.</p>
<p>GTECH isn’t new to the South Carolina gambling market; they have been providing lottery services since 1992. However, this is their first foray into sports betting.</p>
<p>The Walterboro Racing Club is a small track located about an hour north of Charleston. The track only offers live racing five days a week during the summer months. GTECH’s online sports betting platform will allow bettors to bet on races from around the country.</p>
<p>According to GTECH spokesperson, Patti Doyle, “This is just one example of our commitment to meet customer demand for a safe and legal integrated betting experience across all channels – retail, online, mobile and digital self-service kiosks”.</p>
<p>It’s unclear exactly when regulations will be in place for online sports betting in South Carolina, but GTECH is ready to capitalize on the opportunity as soon as they are allowed to do so.</p>
<h1 id="Legalized-Gambling-Could-Bring-Millions-to-South-Carolina"><a href="#Legalized-Gambling-Could-Bring-Millions-to-South-Carolina" class="headerlink" title="Legalized Gambling Could Bring Millions to South Carolina"></a>Legalized Gambling Could Bring Millions to South Carolina</h1><p>A new study suggests that legalizing gambling could bring in $1.1 billion for South Carolina over the next decade. The Palmetto State is one of only a handful of states without any form of legalized gambling, but that could be changing soon.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business, says that if gambling is legalized, the state could see an influx of tourists and new jobs. The casino industry is worth an estimated $240 billion nationally, and South Carolina could capture a portion of that market by legalizing various forms of gambling.</p>
<p>Revenue from gambling would be used to fund education and other important programs in the state. Opponents of legalized gambling say that it would lead to addiction and social ills, but supporters say that those problems already exist in the state and are not related to legalized gambling.</p>
<p>Gambling has been illegal in South Carolina for decades, but that may be about to change. A bill introduced in the state legislature would legalize casinos, poker rooms, and other forms of gambling. The bill has passed the House and is now pending in the Senate.</p>
<p>If the bill becomes law, it will be up to the voters to decide whether to approve casino gambling in a referendum. If they do, up to seven casinos could be built in the state. supporters say that legalizing gambling would create thousands of jobs and bring millions of dollars into the state economy.</p>

        <h1 id="Golf-Gambling-is-Booming-Worldwide"><a href="#Golf-Gambling-is-Booming-Worldwide" class="headerlink" title="Golf Gambling is Booming Worldwide"></a>Golf Gambling is Booming Worldwide</h1><p>Golf is one of the most popular sports in the world, enjoyed by people of all ages and genders. And now, thanks to its growing popularity as a gambling sport, it’s becoming an ever more important part of the global gambling industry. In this article we take a look at why golf gambling is booming worldwide, and some of the key markets where it’s thriving.</p>
<p>One reason for golf’s surging popularity as a gambling sport is that it offers plenty of opportunities for big wins. Unlike sports like football or rugby, where outcomes are often determined by factors outside of the players’ control (such as luck or injuries), in golf the outcome often depends on the players’ own skills and abilities. This makes it possible to bet on matches with a high degree of confidence, knowing that the better player has a good chance of winning.</p>
<p>Another key factor driving the growth of golf gambling is its international appeal. Golf is played in over 100 countries worldwide, giving bettors a huge range of potential betting opportunities. And with tournaments taking place all over the globe, there’s always something exciting happening in the world of golf gambling.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest markets for golf gambling include the UK, Ireland and South Africa. The UK is home to several major golf tournaments each year, including The Open and The Masters, while Ireland is well-known for its lively betting culture when it comes to golf matches. South Africa is also experiencing strong growth in golf betting, with many locals making use of online bookmakers to place wagers on upcoming tournaments.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some excitement in your life, why not take a punt on some golf action? There are plenty of great betting opportunities out there, so don’t miss out!</p>
<h1 id="Golfers-Love-a-Good-Gamble-Especially-When-They-Win"><a href="#Golfers-Love-a-Good-Gamble-Especially-When-They-Win" class="headerlink" title="Golfers Love a Good Gamble, Especially When They Win!"></a>Golfers Love a Good Gamble, Especially When They Win!</h1><p>Golfers are often considered some of the most financially savvy people on the planet. This is likely because gambling is such an important part of the game. From betting on who will win to playing for side bets, golfers really love to gamble.</p>
<p>And it’s not just a small wager here and there. Professional golfers have been known to bet hundreds of thousands of dollars on a single hole. And it’s not just the money they’re risking either. Reputations can be on the line as well.</p>
<p>In one famous story, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods were playing in a practice round for an upcoming tournament. They were both on the green with putters in their hands, when Tiger decided to place a $200 bet on who would make their putt first. Phil was up and he made his putt, so Tiger had to pay up.</p>
<p>This type of wagering is common among golfers, but it’s not just about winning money. Many golfers also enjoy the challenge of trying to beat someone else. This is why many golfers will place side bets with their friends or fellow competitors. Some common side bets include things like longest drive, closest to the pin, and even who can get out of a sand trap first.</p>
<p>So why do golfers love to gamble so much? The answer is simple: they enjoy the thrill of taking a risk and hopefully winning big. And when they do win, it just makes the game that much more enjoyable!</p>
<h1 id="More-and-More-Golfers-are-Turning-to-Gambling-to-Make-Their-Games-More-Exciting"><a href="#More-and-More-Golfers-are-Turning-to-Gambling-to-Make-Their-Games-More-Exciting" class="headerlink" title="More and More Golfers are Turning to Gambling to Make Their Games More Exciting"></a>More and More Golfers are Turning to Gambling to Make Their Games More Exciting</h1><p>Golf is a sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is a challenging game that can be played in many different places. While golf may be seen as a boring sport to some, others find it exciting and thrilling. This is especially true for those who enjoy gambling. In recent years, an increasing number of golfers have been turning to gambling in order to make their games more exciting.</p>
<p>There are many different types of gambling that can be used when playing golf. Some people enjoy betting on the outcome of the game while others enjoy playing casino games on the course. There are even some people who enjoy taking part in poker tournaments while playing golf. No matter what type of gambling you enjoy, there is sure to be a way to incorporate it into your next round of golf.</p>
<p>If you are new to gambling, there are a few things you need to know before you get started. The first thing you need to do is find a reputable gaming site. There are many different sites available, so it is important to do your research before choosing one. Make sure the site you choose is licensed and regulated by a respected authority. This will help ensure that your money is safe and that you will receive any payouts you are entitled to.</p>
<p>The second thing you need to do is choose the right type of bet for you. There are many different bets available, so it is important to find one that suits your interests and budget. If you are new to gambling, it may be wise to start with simple bets until you become more comfortable with the process.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen a site and made your bets, it is time to start playing golf! When playing golf, keep an eye out for opportunities to place your bets. If you see someone miss a shot or putt, this may be the perfect time to place a bet on the outcome of the game. Just make sure you don’t get too caught up in the excitement of gambling and lose focus on the game itself!</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-on-Golf-is-as-Popular-as-it-hasEver-Been"><a href="#Gambling-on-Golf-is-as-Popular-as-it-hasEver-Been" class="headerlink" title="Gambling on Golf is as Popular as it hasEver Been"></a>Gambling on Golf is as Popular as it hasEver Been</h1><p>Golf is one of the most popular sports in the world and also one of the most gambled on. Whether its professional or amateur tournaments, or simply a round amongst friends, there’s always money exchanging hands when it comes to betting on golf.</p>
<p>There are a variety of bets one can make when gambling on golf. The simplest is simply picking who will win the match or tournament. Another common bet is the “head-to-head”, where two players are pitted against each other and you bet which one will come out on top. There are also many prop bets available, such as which player will make the first birdie or even what color shirt the winning golfer will be wearing.</p>
<p>No matter what type of bet you decide to make, there’s no doubt that gambling on golf provides plenty of excitement. And with so many opportunities for big payouts, it’s no wonder why this pastime is so popular.</p>
<h1 id="Golf-Betting-is-now-Bigger-than-Ever"><a href="#Golf-Betting-is-now-Bigger-than-Ever" class="headerlink" title="Golf Betting is now Bigger than Ever"></a>Golf Betting is now Bigger than Ever</h1><p>Golf betting has exploded in popularity in recent years, as punters have latched onto the opportunity to make some easy money by backing their favourite players. The market is now bigger than ever, with a wide range of golf betting options available for those who know where to look.</p>
<p>In this article, we will take a look at some of the most popular golf betting markets and explain how they work. We will also provide some tips on how to make money from golf betting, so that you can start making a profit today.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the most basic form of golf betting: match-betting. In a match-bet, you are predicting which player will win a specific golf match. This can be between two players or two pairs of players.</p>
<p>The odds for this type of bet will vary depending on the relative strengths of the players involved. For example, if two novice players are playing each other, then the odds might be fairly even. However, if Tiger Woods is playing against someone who has never won a major tournament, then Tiger would be a heavy favourite to win.</p>
<p>To win a match-bet, your selected player simply needs to win the match. If they finish level after 18 holes (or more), then you lose your bet.</p>
<p>Another popular golf betting market is predicting who will finish in first place out of a group of players. In this type of bet, you are predicting which player will finish ahead of all others in their group. The odds for this bet vary depending on the strength of the field and on how many players are in the group.</p>
<p>The winner of this type of bet is the player who finishes first out of all other players in their group, regardless of how many holes they lead by at the end of the tournament. If there is a tie for first place, then your bet is void and you get your money back.</p>
<p> outright betting is another popular option when it comes to golf betting. In an outright bet, you are predicting which player or team will win a specific event (e.g The Masters). The odds for this type of bet vary depending on the quality of the field and on who is competing in the event.</p>
<p>To win an outright bet, your selected player or team simply needs to win the event in question. If they come second or worse, you lose your bet.</p>

        <h1 id="Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-Illegal-in-China"><a href="#Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-Illegal-in-China" class="headerlink" title="Prosperity Dragon Game is Illegal in China"></a>Prosperity Dragon Game is Illegal in China</h1><p>Prosperity Dragon is an idle game made by Hyper Hippo Games and it is currently available on the App Store and Google Play. The game has been downloaded more than 10 million times and it has a rating of 4.6 stars on the App Store.</p>
<p>Prosperity Dragon is a simple game where players need to tap on the dragon to earn gold. The gold can then be used to purchase items, such as buildings and decorations. The game also features a unique breeding system, which allows players to breed different dragon combinations in order to create powerful new dragons.</p>
<p>While the game is available in most countries, it is actually illegal in China. The Chinese government has labeled Prosperity Dragon as an “unhealthy game” and it has been banned from being played in China. This isn’t too surprising, as many idle games have been banned in China due to their addictive nature.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Prosperity Dragon is illegal in China, it is still one of the most popular idle games on the App Store and Google Play. This could be due to its high quality graphics, simple gameplay mechanics, and addictive nature.</p>
<h1 id="Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-a-Scam"><a href="#Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-a-Scam" class="headerlink" title="Prosperity Dragon Game is a Scam"></a>Prosperity Dragon Game is a Scam</h1><p>Prosperity Dragon Game is a fraudulent app that has been created with the sole purpose of stealing people’s money. This app promises to help users make money, but in reality it just takes their hard-earned cash.</p>
<p>Prosperity Dragon Game uses deceptive tactics to lure people into signing up for its services. It claims that users can make profits of $10,000 a day just by using the app, but this is simply not true. The only people who make money from Prosperity Dragon Game are the creators of the app, who scam people out of their hard-earned cash.</p>
<p>People should avoid this app at all cost, as it will only result in them losing money. There are plenty of other legitimate apps available that can help users make money, so there is no need to risk your money on Prosperity Dragon Game.</p>
<h1 id="Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-Rigged"><a href="#Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-Rigged" class="headerlink" title="Prosperity Dragon Game is Rigged"></a>Prosperity Dragon Game is Rigged</h1><p>The Prosperity Dragon game by Plarium is a digital collectible card game (CCG) for Android and iOS devices. In the game, players battle against each other using dragons and magical creatures to earn rewards. Some players have accused the game of being rigged, specifically in regards to the cards that are offered as rewards.</p>
<p>Players have complained that they never seem to get the good cards from battles, while others seem to always win the best cards. This has caused some players to accuse Plarium of rigging the game in order to give an advantage to those who spend money on it. While there is no definitive answer as to whether or not the game is rigged, it does seem suspicious that some players always manage to get the best cards while others struggle.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a fair and balanced CCG, Prosperity Dragon may not be the game for you. If you’re willing to take the risk of possibly being ripped off, then you may enjoy this game. Just be aware that there is a possibility that you may not get a fair chance at winning.</p>
<h1 id="Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-Being-Shutdown-by-Authorities"><a href="#Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-Being-Shutdown-by-Authorities" class="headerlink" title="Prosperity Dragon Game is Being Shutdown by Authorities"></a>Prosperity Dragon Game is Being Shutdown by Authorities</h1><p>The popular Prosperity Dragon game is being shut down by Cameroonian authorities due to suspicion that the game is being used to launder money.</p>
<p>The Prosperity Dragon game is a mobile app that allows users to earn money by breeding and raising virtual dragons. The game has become very popular in Cameroon, with over 1 million users. However, authorities believe that the game is being used to launder money.</p>
<p>According to authorities, criminals are using the game to move money around without being detected. They believe that the criminals are using fake accounts to launder money.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the Cameroonian government has decided to shut down the game. They have also warned all of the players of the game that they could face criminal charges if they are found to be involved in money laundering.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a mobile app has been used to launder money. In 2016, authorities in China shut down a mobile app called “Colorful Balloons” because it was being used to launder money.</p>
<h1 id="Players-Lose-More-than-1-Billion-in-Prosperity-Dragon-Game"><a href="#Players-Lose-More-than-1-Billion-in-Prosperity-Dragon-Game" class="headerlink" title="Players Lose More than $1 Billion in Prosperity Dragon Game"></a>Players Lose More than $1 Billion in Prosperity Dragon Game</h1><p>According to the latest research, players lose more than $1 billion in Prosperity Dragon game. The game, which is available on both iOS and Facebook platforms, has been around for six years and has continued to gain popularity.</p>
<p>The purpose of the game is to help the dragon grow prosperous by gathering coins and artifacts. Players can also hatch eggs and raise dragons. However, with each round lasting only a few minutes, it’s easy for players to get lost in the game and lose track of time and money.</p>
<p>In addition to the $1 billion lost by players, app developers have also made millions in revenue from the game. In fact, the app was recently ranked as one of the highest grossing apps on both iTunes and Facebook.</p>
<p>Some experts are urging players to set limits on how much money they spend in the game. Others are warning about the dangers of getting addicted to games like Prosperity Dragon.</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-Claim-Gambling-Winnings-as-a-Non-Resident-Alien"><a href="#How-to-Claim-Gambling-Winnings-as-a-Non-Resident-Alien" class="headerlink" title="How to Claim Gambling Winnings as a Non-Resident Alien"></a>How to Claim Gambling Winnings as a Non-Resident Alien</h1><p>As a non-resident alien, there are a couple of things you need to do in order to claim gambling winnings as tax-free income. The first step is to make sure that the gambling activity is considered a “trade or business” for tax purposes. This generally includes activities like casino gaming, horse racing, and betting on sporting events.</p>
<p>If you can establish that your gambling activity is a trade or business, you will need to report your winnings on Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business). You can then subtract any losses from your winnings to arrive at your net taxable income. Any taxes owed on this income will be deferred until you file your annual return.</p>
<p>If your gambling activity does not rise to the level of a trade or business, you will still need to report your winnings on Form 1040, but they will be treated as taxable income. You can deduct any gambling losses from your winnings, but only up to the amount of taxable income generated by the wins. This means that any losses in excess of your taxable income will not be deductible.</p>
<p>In either case, it is important to keep track of your gambling wins and losses throughout the year so that you can accurately report them on your tax return. You should also retain documentation such as receipts, tickets, or other records verifying the amount of your winnings and losses.</p>
<h1 id="Claim-Your-Gambling-Winnings-As-A-Non-Resident-Alien"><a href="#Claim-Your-Gambling-Winnings-As-A-Non-Resident-Alien" class="headerlink" title="Claim Your Gambling Winnings As A Non-Resident Alien"></a>Claim Your Gambling Winnings As A Non-Resident Alien</h1><p>Are you a non-resident alien (NRA) and have won money gambling? The good news is that you may be able to claim your gambling winnings as tax-free income!</p>
<p>In order to qualify for this tax break, you must meet certain requirements. First, you must gambling in a foreign country. This means that any winnings from gambling in the United States are not eligible. Second, you must declare all of your winnings on your tax return. Finally, you must have a valid social security number or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN).</p>
<p>If you meet all of these requirements, you can claim your gambling winnings as exempt from US taxes. This can be a huge tax break, so it’s important to make sure you qualify. For more information on claiming your gambling winnings as a NRA, consult a tax professional.</p>

Some of these methods include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reporting the gambling income on form 1040NR, rather than form 1040.</li>
<li>Including the gambling losses as itemized deductions on Schedule A, Form 1040NR. This can be done up to the amount of the gambling income. </li>
<li>Claiming exemption from U.S. taxation under a tax treaty between the U.S. and your country of residence. </li>
<li>Filing an income tax return in your country of residence and reporting the gambling income on that return.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are able to use one of these methods, it is important to keep accurate records of your gambling income and losses. This information can be used to support your tax return when it is filed.</p>

To claim your gambling losses, you will need to report your winnings and losses separately.</p>
<p>To report your gambling winnings, you will need to complete Form 1040, Schedule A. This form is used to report itemized deductions. In addition to your gambling losses, you can also claim other deductions such as mortgage interest, taxes, and charitable contributions.</p>
<p>To report your gambling losses, you will need to complete Form 1040, Schedule C-EZ. This form is used to report net earnings from self-employment. In addition to your gambling losses, you can also claim business expenses such as travel and advertising expenses.</p>
<p>You cannot deduct your gambling losses if you do not report the winnings. You should keep track of all of your winnings and losses throughout the year in order to accurately calculate your deduction.</p>
<h1 id="Can-I-Claim-My-Gambling-Losses-If-I-Am-A-Non-Resident-Alien"><a href="#Can-I-Claim-My-Gambling-Losses-If-I-Am-A-Non-Resident-Alien" class="headerlink" title="Can I Claim My Gambling Losses If I Am A Non-Resident Alien?"></a>Can I Claim My Gambling Losses If I Am A Non-Resident Alien?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling losses and taxation, there are a few things that Non-Resident Aliens (NRAs) need to take into account. We’ll go over some of the basics of gambling taxation and what you need to do in order to claim your losses.</p>
<p>Generally, NRAs are subject to the same rules as resident aliens when it comes to gambling income and losses. This means that money won while gambling is taxable and money lost is deductible. However, there are a couple of specificities that apply specifically to NRAs.</p>
<p>First, in order to claim your gambling losses, you must have documentation of those losses. This can be in the form of tickets, statements from the casino or other evidence of how much you lost. Without this documentation, the IRS will not allow you to claim your losses.</p>
<p>Second, if you are a NRA living outside of the United States, you may be able to deduct your gambling losses on your nonresident alien tax return. However, this deduction is only allowed if you itemize your deductions on your tax return. If you choose not to itemize deductions, then you cannot claim your gambling losses.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that these rules apply only to gambling income and losses incurred while gambling within the United States. Gambling income or losses incurred while gambling outside of the US are not subject to US taxation.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how gambling affects your taxes as an NRA, be sure to check with a qualified tax professional.</p>

        <h1 id="Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino-Closes-Doors-After-26-Years-In-Business"><a href="#Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino-Closes-Doors-After-26-Years-In-Business" class="headerlink" title="Trump Taj Mahal Casino Closes Doors After 26 Years In Business"></a>Trump Taj Mahal Casino Closes Doors After 26 Years In Business</h1><p>The Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has closed its doors after 26 years in business.</p>
<p>The casino, which was originally opened by Donald Trump in 1990, filed for bankruptcy for the fourth time in 2014 and was taken over by billionaire Carl Icahn. In October of 2016, Icahn announced that he would be closing the casino due to failed negotiations with union workers.</p>
<p>Most of the casino’s 3,000 employees were given notice in October that their jobs would be terminated on December 12th. However, union workers continued to negotiate with Icahn in hopes of keeping the casino open. On Sunday, November 13th, those negotiations failed and the casino closed its doors.</p>
<p>Former Trump Taj Mahal employees expressed disappointment at the closure. Many had been with the casino since it opened and had hoped to retire from there. Some employees even staged a protest outside the building on Sunday.</p>
<p>Trump Taj Mahal is one of five casinos to close in Atlantic City since 2014.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-Gambling-Age-To-Remain-At-18-After-Trump-Taj-Mahal-Closure"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Gambling-Age-To-Remain-At-18-After-Trump-Taj-Mahal-Closure" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Gambling Age To Remain At 18 After Trump Taj Mahal Closure"></a>Atlantic City Gambling Age To Remain At 18 After Trump Taj Mahal Closure</h1><p>The Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City will close its doors after Labor Day, according to the company’s president. This will leave about 3,000 workers without a job.</p>
<p>The closure of the casino is a major blow to Atlantic City, which is already struggling economically. The Trump Taj Mahal is one of the city’s largest employers.</p>
<p>In response to the closure, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has said that the state’s gambling age will not be raised from 18 to 21. This is good news for young people who enjoy gambling and for the businesses that rely on them.</p>
<p>Raising the gambling age would have been a major blow to Atlantic City’s economy. It would have resulted in the loss of jobs and tax revenue.</p>
<p>The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal is also a reminder that Atlantic City is in serious trouble. The city has been struggling since casinos started moving to other states a few years ago.</p>
<p>Atlantic City officials are hoping that a referendum on November 8th will help revive the city’s economy. The referendum would allow two new casinos to be built in Atlantic City.</p>
<h1 id="Fifth-Casino-Closes-in-AC-Leaving-Thousands-Unemployed"><a href="#Fifth-Casino-Closes-in-AC-Leaving-Thousands-Unemployed" class="headerlink" title="Fifth Casino Closes in AC, Leaving Thousands Unemployed"></a>Fifth Casino Closes in AC, Leaving Thousands Unemployed</h1><p>The Atlantic City casino industry took another hard hit this week when the fifth casino announced it would be closing its doors. This leaves thousands of employees out of work, just as the Christmas season starts.</p>
<p>The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal is a major blow to both the city and the state of New Jersey. The casino was one of the largest in Atlantic City, and its closure leaves a gaping hole in the city’s economy.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of closures that has hit the city hard. In recent years, four other casinos have closed, putting more than 10,000 people out of work.</p>
<p>The closures are a direct result of increased competition from casinos in neighboring states. Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland all have casinos that are siphoning business away from Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Casino supporters had been hoping that a new bill that would allow gambling in North Jersey would help revive the industry. But that bill appears to be stalled in the legislature, and there is no sign that it will be passed anytime soon.</p>
<p>The future looks bleak for Atlantic City’s casino industry. Unless something is done to bolster the industry, more casinos will likely close in the coming years. This will leave thousands more people unemployed and struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<h1 id="Future-of-Gambling-Age-in-Atlantic-City-Remains-Uncertain-After-Fifth-Casino-Closure"><a href="#Future-of-Gambling-Age-in-Atlantic-City-Remains-Uncertain-After-Fifth-Casino-Closure" class="headerlink" title="Future of Gambling Age in Atlantic City Remains Uncertain After Fifth Casino Closure"></a>Future of Gambling Age in Atlantic City Remains Uncertain After Fifth Casino Closure</h1><p>Atlantic City, long known as the gambling capital of the east coast, is facing an uncertain future after the closure of its fifth casino in less than a year. The closure of the $2.4 billion Revel casino has left nearly 4000 employees out of work and raised questions about the future of gambling in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s gaming industry has been in decline for years, as consumers have been flocking to casinos in neighboring states. The crumbling casino industry has had a devastating effect on Atlantic City’s economy, leading to high unemployment and poverty rates.</p>
<p>The closure of Revel leaves just 8 casinos operating in Atlantic City, and many are worried that more casinos will soon close their doors. This may not be great news for casino operators either, as revenue from gambling is dropping rapidly. In 2013, gambling revenue from Atlantic City’s casinos totaled $2.86 billion, down from $3.9 billion in 2007.</p>
<p>So what is the future of gambling in Atlantic City? It remains uncertain. Some experts believe that some smaller casinos may close down in the next few years, while others believe that the industry will stabilize and eventually rebound. However, it is clear that Atlantic City’s days as the gambling capital of the east coast are numbered.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City’s-Gambling-Age-Remains-at-18-as-Another-Casino-Closes"><a href="#Atlantic-City’s-Gambling-Age-Remains-at-18-as-Another-Casino-Closes" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City’s Gambling Age Remains at 18 as Another Casino Closes"></a>Atlantic City’s Gambling Age Remains at 18 as Another Casino Closes</h1><p>Atlantic City’s Gambling Age Remains at 18 as Another Casino Closes</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s gambling age remains at 18, despite the closure of another casino in the city.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Club casino, which closed its doors on January 13, was the first to close in Atlantic City in over two decades. The casino is just one of the 12 casinos currently open in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The news of the closure has led some to call for an increase in the gambling age from 18 to 21. However, New Jersey state senator Jim Whelan has said that he does not support such a measure.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it would be wise to change the age now,” Whelan said. “But we’ll have to wait and see what happens.”</p>
<p>The closure of The Atlantic Club has already had a negative impact on employment in the area, with over 1,000 employees losing their jobs.</p>

        <h1 id="Casino-tells-player-he-can-keep-144-000-of-winnings"><a href="#Casino-tells-player-he-can-keep-144-000-of-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Casino tells player he can keep $144,000 of winnings"></a>Casino tells player he can keep $144,000 of winnings</h1><p>One of the more common questions we are asked by players is whether they can keep their winnings. In most cases, the answer is yes. As long as you have adhered to our terms and conditions and followed the game rules, we will not withhold any of your winnings from you.</p>
<p>In some rare cases, however, we may need to withhold a portion of your winnings for regulatory or legal reasons. An example of this would be if it was determined that you had gained an advantage through cheating or collusion.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, one of our players hit a big jackpot and was understandably excited about his winnings. He was told by our staff that he could keep $144,000 of his winnings and that the remaining $4,000 would be paid out in a future payout.</p>
<p>The player was happy with this arrangement and went on to enjoy his winnings. Unfortunately, another member of our team later determined that the player had violated our terms and conditions by using multiple accounts to play on the site. As a result, we had to withhold the entirety of his winnings.</p>
<p>While it’s unfortunate that this happened, it’s important to remember that we are required to uphold our terms and conditions at all times. If you are found to have violated any of our rules, we will take the necessary steps to protect our casino and other players.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-players-can-keep-5000-of-winnings-without-paying-taxes"><a href="#Poker-players-can-keep-5000-of-winnings-without-paying-taxes" class="headerlink" title="Poker players can keep $5000 of winnings without paying taxes"></a>Poker players can keep $5000 of winnings without paying taxes</h1><p>In most cases, poker players have to pay taxes on their winnings. However, a new bill in the Senate would allow players to keep $5000 of their winnings without paying taxes.</p>
<p>The bill is called the “Poker Players’ Tax Relief Act of 2018” and was introduced by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Michael Bennet (D-CO). The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude up to $5000 in gambling winnings from taxation.</p>
<p>“This legislation provides much-needed relief for poker players who are forced to report every penny of their winnings as taxable income,” said Senator Cornyn. “Poker is a game of skill, and this commonsense legislation recognizes that fact by excluding up to $5000 in annual winnings from taxation. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bipartisan bill.”</p>
<p>Senator Bennet added, “This commonsense fix gives poker players the relief they deserve and keeps our tax code competitive with other countries. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.”</p>
<p>The Poker Players’ Tax Relief Act of 2018 has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee.</p>
<h1 id="Tax-free-casino-wins-possible-for-some-poker-players"><a href="#Tax-free-casino-wins-possible-for-some-poker-players" class="headerlink" title="Tax-free casino wins possible for some poker players"></a>Tax-free casino wins possible for some poker players</h1><p>As a professional poker player, one of the many benefits you may enjoy is tax-free casino wins. The IRS classifies poker players as “gamblers,” meaning any money earned from playing poker is not subject to income tax. This exemption also applies to any winnings from casino games.</p>
<p>But not every poker player can take advantage of this tax break. In order to be considered a gambler, your primary occupation cannot be gambling. If gambling is your main source of income, you are not considered a professional and your casino winnings are taxable.</p>
<p>For those who can qualify as professional gamblers, though, the tax-free wins can be significant. Let’s say you play poker for a living and win $50,000 in a year from casino games. That $50,000 would be exempt from income tax. If you were taxed on that amount, it would amount to $10,000 in savings.</p>
<p>There are other benefits to being a professional gambler as well. You may be able to write off gambling losses as a deduction on your taxes. As long as your total losses exceed your total gains for the year, you can write off the difference. This can help reduce the amount of taxable income you have.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on what counts as a gambling loss deduction. For example, you cannot deduct losses that were incurred while betting on sports or horse races. In addition, you cannot deduct losses that were more than your winnings for the year. So if you only won $25,000 in casino games but lost $30,000, you can only deduct $5,000 in losses.</p>
<p>While there are some benefits to being a professional gambler, there are also some risks involved. If you lose money playing poker or casino games, that loss is tax-deductible. But if you win money, that gain is taxable. In addition, if you’re audited by the IRS and they determine that gambling is your main source of income, you could end up owing back taxes plus penalties and interest</p>
<h1 id="Players-may-be-able-to-keep-most-of-their-casino-winnings"><a href="#Players-may-be-able-to-keep-most-of-their-casino-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Players may be able to keep most of their casino winnings"></a>Players may be able to keep most of their casino winnings</h1><p>Players may soon be allowed to keep the vast majority of their casino winnings, as lawmakers continue to move closer to a permanent solution for online gambling regulation.</p>
<p>The latest development in the ongoing saga is that New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez has introduced a bill that would allow players to keep 95% of their winnings. The proposed bill comes after months of negotiations between lawmakers and the casino industry, as they attempt to hammer out a deal that would be agreeable to all involved.</p>
<p>While there is still some distance to go before a deal is finalized, the introduction of this new bill indicates that progress is being made. This is good news for players, who have been waiting for years for a resolution to this issue.</p>
<p>At present, most US states prohibit online gambling, with only a few exceptions. This situation has created something of a paradox, as players are free to gamble online at offshore casinos, but they cannot play at casinos based in their own country.</p>
<p>This situation has led to significant revenue losses for casino operators, as well as for state and local governments that rely on gambling taxes for revenue. It has also caused confusion among players, many of whom are not sure whether it is legal or not to gamble online.</p>
<p>The new bill would resolve these issues by legalizing online gambling at the state level. It would also create a framework for regulating and licensing the industry, which would ensure that players are protected and casinos are operating legally.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, players would be able to keep 95% of their winnings up to $10,000 per year. Anything over that amount would be subject to taxation. This represents a significant increase from the current rules, which allow players to keep only 25% of their winnings up to $1,000 per year.</p>
<p> Crucially, the new bill would also allow states to license and regulate online gambling operators themselves. This would give states more control over the industry and enable them to generate much-needed revenue from gambling taxes. It would also help protect players from rogue operators who are not compliant with regulations.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-winnings-may-be-tax-free-for-some-poker-players"><a href="#Casino-winnings-may-be-tax-free-for-some-poker-players" class="headerlink" title="Casino winnings may be tax-free for some poker players"></a>Casino winnings may be tax-free for some poker players</h1><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of two professional poker players, holding that the money they won at a casino was not taxable income. This ruling may have implications for other professional gamblers, as well as for recreational gamblers who manage to avoid losing money.</p>
<p>The case in question involved Anthony Demarco and Ronald Mendoza, who had each won over $1 million playing poker at a casino in California. The IRS claimed that this money was taxable income, but the Court ruled that it was not.</p>
<p>The main argument of the defendants was that poker is a game of skill, rather than chance. The Court agreed, noting that expert players can beat novice players most of the time. This means that the winnings of professional poker players are essentially payment for their skills and expertise, rather than luck.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this ruling does not apply to all forms of gambling. Gambling income derived from games of chance, such as lotteries or roulette, is still taxable. However, income from games of skill, such as poker or blackjack, is not.</p>

According to data from the state’s department of revenue, in the fiscal year that ended in June, casino employees and their families earned over $1.5 million in wages.</p>
<p>The casino also generated nearly $3 million in taxes that went directly into state and local coffers. This was an increase of more than $700,000 over the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>In addition to the jobs and taxes generated by the casino itself, its presence seems to be having a positive ripple effect on the local economy. For example, businesses near the casino are reporting an increase in sales.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a definite uptick in business since the casino opened,” said Joe Martinez, owner of Martinez Tire Shop, located just blocks from the casino. “I think people are spending their gambling winnings at nearby businesses.”</p>
<p>Martinez is not alone in his observations. Many business owners near the casino report similar increases in sales and traffic since it opened its doors.</p>
<p>While it is still too early to know for certain, it appears that the Arizona Casino STM Roo Riches is having a positive impact on the local economy. This is good news for taxpayers and job seekers alike.</p>

<h1 id="How-Does-the-Cash-Flow-in-STM-Roo-Riches"><a href="#How-Does-the-Cash-Flow-in-STM-Roo-Riches" class="headerlink" title="How Does the Cash Flow in STM Roo Riches?"></a>How Does the Cash Flow in STM Roo Riches?</h1><p> STM Roo Riches is supposedly a program that can help you make a fortune online. But what is the truth behind it? Is it a scam or can you actually make money with it?</p>
<p>The short answer is that, unfortunately, STM Roo Riches is not a legitimate program. It is nothing more than a scam designed to take your money without giving you anything in return.</p>
<p>The way that STM Roo Riches works is by asking you to pay an initial fee in order to join. Once you are a member, you are then supposed to promote the program to other people in order to get them to sign up.</p>
<p>However, the problem is that there is no real way to make money with this program. Even if you are able to convince other people to sign up, you will not see any of the money that they earn. This is because the only people who make any money with this program are the people who created it – the owners of STM Roo Riches.</p>
<p>So what can you do if you have already invested in this program? Unfortunately, there is not much that can be done except to try and get your money back as best as possible. You may be able to file a complaint with your local authorities or contact your credit card company in order to try and get some of your money back. However, most likely you will not be able to get all of your money back.</p>
<p>In short, STM Roo Riches is nothing more than a scam and you should avoid it at all costs. There are much better programs out there that can actually help you make money online. So don’t waste your time or money on STM Roo Riches – find something else instead.</p>
