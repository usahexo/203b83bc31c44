First, we’ll explain what counts as gambling income and losses, and then we’ll give you the step-by-step instructions on how to add them to your tax return.</p>
<p>What counts as gambling income?</p>
<p>Gambling income includes any money or items of value that you won while gambling. This includes winnings from casino games, lotteries, and other wagers. It also includes any money that you took in as a result of cashing in winning chips or tickets.</p>
<p>What counts as gambling losses?</p>
<p>Gambling losses include any money or items of value that you lost while gambling. This includes losses from casino games, lotteries, and other wagers. It also includes any money that you paid to gamble (e.g., tips and entrance fees).</p>
<p>How do I report gambling income and losses?</p>
<p>To report your gambling income and losses on TurboTax, you’ll need to create a new IRS Schedule C. This schedule is used to report business income and expenses. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-schedules-c-and-f">https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-schedules-c-and-f</a> and download Schedule C (Form 1040). This is the form that you will use to report your gambling income and losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On line 1 of Schedule C, enter the name of your business. In the space provided, write “Gambling Income&#x2F;Losses”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On line 2, enter your total gambling income for the year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On line 3, enter your total gambling losses for the year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Subtract line 3 from line 2 to calculate your net gambling income for the year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter this amount on line 21 of Form 1040 (the main tax return form).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attach Schedule C to your tax return.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-to-add-gambling-winnings-and-expenses-on-TurboTax"><a href="#How-to-add-gambling-winnings-and-expenses-on-TurboTax" class="headerlink" title="How to add gambling winnings and expenses on TurboTax"></a>How to add gambling winnings and expenses on TurboTax</h1><p>Adding gambling winnings and expenses on TurboTax is easy. You will need to report your income and expenses on Schedule 1 of your tax return.</p>
<p>To report your gambling winnings, you will need to know the amount of your winnings and the type of gambling. Gambling income includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and casinos. Winnings from other types of gambling, such as poker games, are not included in gambling income.</p>
<p>To report your expenses, you must keep track of the amount of your losses and the type of gambling. Gambling losses include any money or the fair market value of anything you lost while gambling. You can’t deduct the cost of your ticket to the casino or race track.</p>
<p>To claim your gambling income and deductions on TurboTax, follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open TurboTax and click on “File” then “OpenForms.”</li>
<li>Select “Schedule 1 - Income” from the list of forms.</li>
<li>On Part 1 - Identification (lines 1-6), enter all information about yourself including name, Social Security number (SSN), address, etc.</li>
<li>On line 7, indicate that you had gambling income by selecting “Yes” from the drop-down box. </li>
<li>In Part II - Gambling Winnings&#x2F;Losses (lines 8-21), enter all information about your gambling income and deductions.</li>
</ol>
<p>a) On line 8, enter the amount of your winnings from all types of gambling .<br>b) On line 9a, enter the date(s) of the event(s).<br>c) In column (b), indicate whether it was a gain or loss (net).<br>d) If it was a gain, enter that amount in column (d).<br>e) If it was a loss, enter that amount in column (d) and also subtract it from line 8. This will be positive if it’s a loss.)<br>f) On lines 10-21, repeat this process for each type of wager and include any winning or losing free tickets you may have received as part of playing bingo or other games at a charitable event sanctioned by the state lottery commission.(For more info on how to report free tickets go to irs Publication 525 page 24).  6) When you’re finished entering information into lines 8-21, click on “Continue.” The program will automatically calculate totals for gains and losses for you.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-report-gambling-income-and-losses-on-TurboTax"><a href="#How-to-report-gambling-income-and-losses-on-TurboTax" class="headerlink" title="How to report gambling income and losses on TurboTax"></a>How to report gambling income and losses on TurboTax</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, but it can also be a great way to make some money. Unfortunately, gambling income and losses are not always easy to track. Here’s how to report gambling income and losses on TurboTax.</p>
<p>To report gambling income on TurboTax, you will first need to know the amount of your winnings and losses. You will then need to report your winnings and losses on Schedule A as miscellaneous income.</p>
<p>If you have net gambling losses for the year, you may be able to claim them as a deduction on your tax return. To claim your losses, you will need to complete IRS Form 1040, Schedule A. You can then enter the amount of your losses on line 28 of Schedule A.</p>
<p>It is important to note that only net losses can be claimed as a deduction. This means that you cannot deduct the amount of your winnings from the amount of your losses. In addition, you cannot claim any costs associated with gambling as a deduction.</p>
<p>Gambling income and losses can be a complicated topic, so it is important to consult with a tax professional if you have any questions.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-calculate-your-gambling-taxes-with-TurboTax"><a href="#How-to-calculate-your-gambling-taxes-with-TurboTax" class="headerlink" title="How to calculate your gambling taxes with TurboTax"></a>How to calculate your gambling taxes with TurboTax</h1><p>There are a few steps you need to take in order to calculate your gambling taxes correctly with TurboTax. First, report all of your gambling income on line 21 of your 1040 tax form. This will include winnings from casinos, racetracks, lotteries, and any other gambling sources.</p>
<p>Next, subtract your gambling losses from your gambling income. This amount goes on line 28 of the 1040 form. If you have any records or documentation for your losses, be sure to submit them with your return.</p>
<p>Finally, enter the total of your winnings and losses on Form 1040 Schedule A. This will determine if you have any taxable income from gambling. If so, it will be included on line 8 of the Schedule A form.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that you can only deduct your gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you had $1,000 in winnings and $2,000 in losses, you can only deduct $1,000 on Schedule A.</p>
<p>Figuring out your gambling taxes can be confusing, but TurboTax can make it easy for you. With just a few simple steps, you can be confident that you’re filing your taxes correctly and getting the most money back possible.</p>

        <h1 id="Casino-Gambling-Can-Be-Addictive-How-Much-Is-Too-Much"><a href="#Casino-Gambling-Can-Be-Addictive-How-Much-Is-Too-Much" class="headerlink" title="Casino Gambling Can Be Addictive - How Much Is Too Much?"></a>Casino Gambling Can Be Addictive - How Much Is Too Much?</h1><p>Casino gambling can be a fun and exciting way to spend some free time, but for some people it can also be addictive. How much casino gambling is too much?</p>
<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling says that any gambling behavior that disrupts day-to-day activities or results in negative consequences is considered to be a problem. This can include spending too much money, borrowing money from family or friends to gamble with, lying about how much was gambled or lost, or feeling anxious or depressed because of gambling.</p>
<p>If you are concerned that you may be addicted to casino gambling, there are several things you can do to assess the situation. First, track your spending on gambling over a period of time. If you are spending more than you can afford, or if you are using money that was meant for other purposes, then this is a sign that casino gambling may be becoming a problem.</p>
<p>Another indication that casino gambling may be addictive is if you are unable to stop playing, even when you know it is causing harm to yourself or others. If you find yourself thinking about gambling all the time, plotting ways to get more money to gamble with, or feeling panicked or stressed when you don’t have access to your favourite games, these are all signs of addiction.</p>
<p>If you feel like you may have a problem with casino gambling, it’s important to get help as soon as possible. There are lots of resources available for people who want to overcome an addiction to casino gambling, including counselling and support groups.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Is-Too-Much-To-Gamble-In-A-Casino"><a href="#How-Much-Is-Too-Much-To-Gamble-In-A-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Much Is Too Much To Gamble In A Casino?"></a>How Much Is Too Much To Gamble In A Casino?</h1><p>When you walk into a casino, there are flashing lights and sounds that are designed to lure you in. The casino staff is friendly and polite, and they want you to gamble. They want you to bet your money and hope for the best. But how much is too much to gamble in a casino?</p>
<p>There is no definitive answer, but it’s important to know your limits. Gambling can be addictive, and if you’re not careful, you could wind up losing more than you intended. Before you go to a casino, decide how much money you’re willing to risk. If you go over that limit, walk away from the table. You can always come back later.</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that casinos are designed to make money. The odds are always against the player, so don’t bet more than you can afford to lose. If you’re on a winning streak, take your profits and leave the table. There’s no need to risk it all in hopes of hitting the jackpot.</p>
<p>Most importantly, have fun! Gambling should be a recreational activity, not a way to make money. If you’re not enjoying yourself, stop playing and walk away. There’s no need to get angry or frustrated; just take a break until you’re feeling more relaxed.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, but it’s important to remember that it’s also risky. Know your limits and have fun!</p>
<h1 id="Is-Casino-Gambling-Bad-For-You-How-Much-Is-Too-Much"><a href="#Is-Casino-Gambling-Bad-For-You-How-Much-Is-Too-Much" class="headerlink" title="Is Casino Gambling Bad For You? How Much Is Too Much?"></a>Is Casino Gambling Bad For You? How Much Is Too Much?</h1><p>There is no one definitive answer to the question of whether casino gambling is bad for you. Some people can enjoy occasional gambling without any negative consequences, while others may find themselves quickly addicted and unable to stop. In general, it is probably best to avoid getting too caught up in casino gambling, as it can be both costly and dangerous.</p>
<p>How much is too much when it comes to casino gambling? This depends on the individual. Some people can gamble responsibly without any problems, while others may find themselves spending more and more time and money at the casino, eventually wrecking their finances and relationships in the process. It is usually best to err on the side of caution and not gamble more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<p> Casino gambling can be enjoyable and entertaining for some people, but it can also be addictive and destructive. If you are unsure about whether casino gambling is right for you, it’s best to steer clear altogether.</p>
<h1 id="What’s-The-Harm-In-Gambling-How-Much-Is-Too-Much"><a href="#What’s-The-Harm-In-Gambling-How-Much-Is-Too-Much" class="headerlink" title="What’s The Harm In Gambling? How Much Is Too Much?"></a>What’s The Harm In Gambling? How Much Is Too Much?</h1><p>As with most things in life, there is a tipping point when it comes to gambling. Too much can have detrimental consequences on not just your bank account, but also your physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Gambling can be an addictive behaviour. The thrill of betting and the potential for winning money can be alluring, especially when money is tight. However, spending more money than you can afford in the hope of winning big can quickly spiral out of control. This can lead to financial stress and problems in other areas of your life.</p>
<p>Heavy gambling can also have a negative impact on your physical health. Stressed people often turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms like drinking, smoking or eating junk food. Gambling addicts are also more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>The good news is that gambling addiction is treatable. If you think you may have a problem with gambling, talk to your doctor or seek professional help.</p>
<h1 id="When-Does-Gambling-Become-A-Problem-How-Much-Is-too-much"><a href="#When-Does-Gambling-Become-A-Problem-How-Much-Is-too-much" class="headerlink" title="When Does Gambling Become A Problem? How Much Is too much"></a>When Does Gambling Become A Problem? How Much Is too much</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but when does it become a problem? How much is too much?</p>
<p>There’s no one answer to this question since gambling can affect different people in different ways. However, there are some general guidelines you can follow to help determine if you or someone you know may have a gambling problem.</p>
<p>If gambling is causing financial problems, relationship problems, work problems, or legal problems, then it is likely considered a problem. Gambling that results in significant debt or even bankruptcy is also a sign of a problem. If you are unable to resist the urge to gamble, even when it’s causing harm in your life, then that’s another sign of a problem.</p>
<p>In general, experts recommend staying away from any type of gambling if it disrupts your life in any way. If you can’t control your gambling behavior or if it’s starting to cause negative consequences, it’s time to seek help.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know needs help with gambling addiction, there are many resources available. There are also several self-help groups available for those affected by gambling addiction.</p>

        <h1 id="Casino-Wins-Lawsuit-Regarding-Online-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Casino-Wins-Lawsuit-Regarding-Online-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Casino Wins Lawsuit Regarding Online Sports Betting"></a>Casino Wins Lawsuit Regarding Online Sports Betting</h1><p>The federal government has quietly settled a lawsuit with a group of online casinos, essentially giving them the green light to offer sports betting to their customers.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed the lawsuit in 2011, alleging that the casinos were violating the federal Wire Act by allowing customers to place bets on sporting events over the Internet. The act prohibits gambling businesses from using interstate wire communications to place bets.</p>
<p>But last week, the DOJ informed magistrate judge James Cacheris that it had reached a settlement with the casinos and would not be opposing their motion to dismiss the case. As part of the settlement, the DOJ will not take any action against the casinos for offering sports betting services, as long as those services are offered only to customers in states where it is legal to do so.</p>
<p>This is a huge victory for the online casino industry, which has been lobbying for years to get the Wire Act overturned. The act was originally passed in 1961 in an effort to crack down on organized crime’s involvement in gambling, but it has been interpreted since then as prohibiting all online gambling.</p>
<p>However, many states have now legalized some form of online gambling, including sports betting, and the casino industry has argued that the Wire Act should not apply in these cases.</p>
<p>In its motion to dismiss, lawyers for the casinos argued that Congress never intended for the Wire Act to apply to state-regulated gambling activities. They also pointed out that several courts have ruled that state-regulated online gambling is not prohibited by the act.</p>
<p>In a statement issued last week, casino industry trade group American Gaming Association (AGA) praised the DOJ’s decision and said it was “an important development for those who want to see legal and accountable sports betting available in America.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, New Jersey became the first state to legalize sports betting after successfully challenging the federal ban on such activities. Other states are now considering similar measures.</p>
<h1 id="Two-Men’s-Gambling-Adventure-Ends-in-Victory"><a href="#Two-Men’s-Gambling-Adventure-Ends-in-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Two Men’s Gambling Adventure Ends in Victory"></a>Two Men’s Gambling Adventure Ends in Victory</h1><p>In casinos all over the world, there are stories of people who have hit it big. Sometimes these tales come from guests who have had a stroke of luck at the slots or roulette table. Other times, they stem from seasoned veterans who have perfected a system and can consistently beat the house edge. But what about the unlucky souls who go to great lengths only to come out empty-handed?</p>
<p>Such was the case for John and George, two friends who traveled to Las Vegas for a gambling adventure. Neither one of them had ever been to a casino before, so they were pretty excited to try their luck. They hit up a few different ones in town and started off by playing slot machines. Unfortunately, they didn’t seem to be blessed with any good luck and they both lost money fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Next, they decided to give roulette a try. This proved to be more costly still, as they kept losing large sums of cash on unlucky spins. With their bankrolls dwindling quickly, they began to worry that their trip was going to end in disaster.</p>
<p>But then something amazing happened. George won a large bet on red at the roulette table, putting them back in the black for the first time all day. Encouraged by this bit of good fortune, they decided to keep playing - and promptly lost it all again!</p>
<p>Undeterred, they tried their luck at another table and once more George managed to win big. This time, he walked away with over $1,000 in profits! John was thrilled for his friend and happy that things had turned around for them. They decided to call it a night and head back to their hotel room with some extra cash in their pockets.</p>
<p>Although their overall trip wasn’t a success from a gambling standpoint, George and John can still look back on it fondly as an exciting adventure. And who knows - maybe they’ll be able to bring home even more money on their next visit!</p>
<h1 id="Court-Rules-in-Favor-of-Legitimate-Online-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Court-Rules-in-Favor-of-Legitimate-Online-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Court Rules in Favor of Legitimate Online Sports Betting"></a>Court Rules in Favor of Legitimate Online Sports Betting</h1><p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit just ruled in favor of a New Jersey law that would legalize sports betting, overturning a 1992 federal law that barred states from authorizing sports betting. This ruling could have major implications for the future of online sports betting, as it opens up the possibility for other states to legalize and regulate the practice.</p>
<p>Online sports betting has become increasingly popular in recent years, as more and more people have begun to use the internet to place bets on sporting events. However, this activity has been technically illegal in the United States since 1992, when Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA).</p>
<p>This law essentially prohibited all states from legalizing and regulating sports betting, with the exception of Nevada. As a result, online sports betting was forced to operate in a legal grey area, as there was no clear guidance on whether or not it was allowed.</p>
<p>This changed last year, when New Jersey passed a law legalizing sports betting within the state. The NCAA and four major professional sports leagues (the NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL) sued New Jersey to block this law, arguing that it violated PASPA.</p>
<p>However, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals just ruled in favor of New Jersey, stating that PASPA is unconstitutional. This ruling could pave the way for other states to legalize and regulate online sports betting, which would provide much-needed clarity on the legality of this activity.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that this ruling only applies to states that have already legalized some form of gambling. So far, fifteen states have done so, including New Jersey. However, many other states are currently considering similar legislation, so it’s likely that we will see more states begin to legalize sports betting in the near future.</p>
<p>This ruling is great news for fans of online sports betting, as it removes some of the ambiguity surrounding this activity. It also ensures that online sports betting will be regulated and monitored by state officials, which should help protect consumers against fraud and corruption.</p>
<h1 id="Justice-Served-in-Battle-Over-Online-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Justice-Served-in-Battle-Over-Online-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Justice Served in Battle Over Online Sports Betting"></a>Justice Served in Battle Over Online Sports Betting</h1><p>The firing of a Justice Department lawyer who successfully challenged the federal government’s ban on sports betting has cheered the gambling industry but puzzled some legal experts.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why they would get rid of this guy,” said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington. “There’s no obvious explanation.”</p>
<p>The lawyer, Paul Clement, was highly respected within the department and had argued nine cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. He also had political connections; his wife is Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli’s chief of staff.</p>
<p>Clement’s termination came shortly after he and colleagues persuaded the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down a 1992 federal law that prohibited states from allowing sports betting. The decision opened the door for states to allow gambling on sports, including football, basketball and baseball.</p>
<p>The Obama administration had decided not to defend the law, but when Clement took over as acting Solicitor General in March 2011, he decided to keep fighting the case. In a surprising move last December, he won an 8-0 victory before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Despite his impressive track record, Clement was unexpectedly let go on April 2. His departure left many in the legal community scratching their heads, especially since he had been offered a prestigious position with a New York law firm starting in June.</p>
<p>Justice Department officials offered no explanation for Clement’s firing beyond saying that it was “time for a change.” But some insiders say that Clement’s victory over the sports gambling ban may have played a role in his dismissal.</p>
<p>“It is no secret that there are people in this town who don’t like what Paul did on the sports betting case,” one department official told The National Law Journal. “I’m sure that played into this.”</p>
<p>Others dismissed such speculation and pointed to more plausible explanations for Clement’s firing, such as partisan politics or his wife’s high-profile job with Cuccinelli’s campaign. But until the Justice Department offers a better explanation, many will see Clement’s termination as nothing more than another case of Washington politics at work.</p>
<h1 id="Legal-System-Upholds-Integrity-of-Online-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Legal-System-Upholds-Integrity-of-Online-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Legal System Upholds Integrity of Online Sports Betting"></a>Legal System Upholds Integrity of Online Sports Betting</h1><p>The recent legalisation of sports betting in the United States has come as a big win for the online gambling industry. This move by the government is seen as a way to safeguard the integrity of sports, while also bringing in new revenue streams through taxation.</p>
<p>The legalisation of sports betting has been a long time coming, with various states having dabbled in the practice for some time now. However, it was only with the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) that things really started to take off. This move by the government has allowed states to decide for themselves whether they want to legalise and regulate sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>As you would expect, there has been a lot of opposition to this decision from religious groups and other conservative organisations. However, many experts believe that legalising sports betting is the right thing to do, as it will protect consumers and safeguard the integrity of sport.</p>
<p>One key benefit of legalising sports betting is that it will provide new revenue streams for state governments. Not only will this money be used to fund important public services, but it will also help to reduce budget deficits. In addition, it is estimated that taxes collected on sports bets could generate up to $6 billion in new revenue each year.</p>
<p>Another important benefit of legalised sports betting is that it will help to protect consumers from unscrupulous operators. By regulating the industry, state governments can ensure that players are protected from fraud and abuse. This is particularly important given that online gambling can be quite risky, as there is no way to physically inspect the premises of an operator.</p>
<p>Finally, legalising sports betting will help to protect the integrity of sport. By ensuring that all bets are placed through licensed and regulated operators, state governments can make sure that no funny business takes place. This is critical given the billions of dollars at stake in professional sporting events each year.</p>
<p>Overall, it is clear that legalising sports betting is a positive step for both consumers and operators alike. By providing new revenue streams for state governments and safeguarding the integrity of sport, this move should prove to be a win-win for all involved.</p>

        <h1 id="Literary-Great-Allen-Poe-Goes-Bankrupt-After-First-Gambling-Incident"><a href="#Literary-Great-Allen-Poe-Goes-Bankrupt-After-First-Gambling-Incident" class="headerlink" title="Literary Great Allen Poe Goes Bankrupt After First Gambling Incident"></a>Literary Great Allen Poe Goes Bankrupt After First Gambling Incident</h1><p>Author and poet, Allen Poe, went bankrupt after his first known gambling incident. The bankruptcy filing happened in 1827, two years after Poe’s first known gambling episode.</p>
<p>The public records show that Poe had liabilities of $1,584.76 and assets of only $96.97. This would have been a significant amount of money at the time, especially for someone who was not well-known.</p>
<p>There is no indication as to how Poe managed to squander such a large sum of money or where the money actually went. However, given that this was Poe’s first known foray into gambling, it is likely that he lost a great deal of money in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this was also around the same time that Poe’s writing career was taking off. He had published several pieces in magazines and journals and was starting to gain attention from the literary elite. It is possible that he spent more money than he could afford in an effort to promote his work or maintain his lifestyle.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, it is clear that Poe’s first gambling experience was not a successful one. This incident would go on to have a significant impact on his personal life and career trajectory.</p>
<h1 id="Unemployed-and-In-Debt-Allen-Poe-Turns-to-Gambling-for-Relief"><a href="#Unemployed-and-In-Debt-Allen-Poe-Turns-to-Gambling-for-Relief" class="headerlink" title="Unemployed and In Debt, Allen Poe Turns to Gambling for Relief"></a>Unemployed and In Debt, Allen Poe Turns to Gambling for Relief</h1><p>Allen Poe hit a low point in his life when he was laid off from his job of 30 years and found that he owed more than $60,000 in debt. He struggled to find other work in a sluggish economy and soon found himself turning to gambling as a way to make ends meet.</p>
<p>At first, Allen’s gambling was relatively innocuous - he would bet on sports games or play the occasional slots game. However, as his debts mounted, Allen began placing bigger and bigger bets in order to try and win back what he had lost. This soon led to a habit of gambling that was spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>Allen’s wife and children were concerned about their father’s behavior, but he refused to listen to their warnings. He told them that he could handle his gambling and that it wasn’t a big deal. In reality, Allen was just trying to hold onto his false sense of control.</p>
<p>As his debts continued to grow, Allen became more and more desperate. He would stay up all night gambling online and then spend the days looking for new ways to make money. His health started to suffer as a result of all the stress and anxiety that accompanied his gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Finally, Allen’s family staged an intervention and got him into treatment for his addiction. It was only after getting help that Allen was able to see how much damage he had done to himself and his family. He is now on the road to recovery and working towards repairing the damage that he has caused.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help immediately. Gambling can be extremely addictive and can ruin your life if left unchecked. There are many resources available for those who need help, so don’t hesitate to ask for assistance.</p>
<h1 id="Allen-Poe’s-Addiction-to-Gambling-Costs-Him-His-Home-and-Fortune"><a href="#Allen-Poe’s-Addiction-to-Gambling-Costs-Him-His-Home-and-Fortune" class="headerlink" title="Allen Poe’s Addiction to Gambling Costs Him His Home and Fortune"></a>Allen Poe’s Addiction to Gambling Costs Him His Home and Fortune</h1><p>Legendary American author, Allen Poe, was known for his dark and macabre writing, as well as his addiction to gambling. Many believe that it was this addiction that led to his ruin. In 1837, Poe lost his home and most of his possessions after a night of gambling at a casino in Baltimore. To make matters worse, he extremely in debt to numerous creditors.</p>
<p>It is documented that Poe continued to gamble heavily throughout the 1840s, losing tens of thousands of dollars in the process. This eventually led to him filing for bankruptcy in 1849. In a letter written shortly before his death, Poe lamented his tragic life, stating “In the ardor of pursuit, I have squandered my property . . . my health is greatly impaired . . . my reputation is gone.” It is truly tragic that such a talented writer was brought down by his addiction to gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Famous-Author-Allen-Poe-Rams-Through-Poverty-Barrier-After-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Famous-Author-Allen-Poe-Rams-Through-Poverty-Barrier-After-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Famous Author Allen Poe Rams Through Poverty Barrier After Gambling Debts"></a>Famous Author Allen Poe Rams Through Poverty Barrier After Gambling Debts</h1><p>Famous author, Allen Poe, was born in 1809 to a David Poe Jr. and Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe. The family was moderately well off until 1811 when David Poe Sr., Allan’s grandfather, lost a large sum of money in a bad investment. This caused the family to fall into poverty and forced Edgar, Allan’s father, to leave home and join the military. To make matters worse, Allan’s mother died in 1811 from tuberculosis. Allan was then taken into the home of John and Frances Allan who were childless.</p>
<p>The Allans were not able to completely erase Allan’s past and he continued to struggle with poverty his entire life. In 1826, Allan would enter the University of Virginia but because of his lack of funds, had to leave after one year. He would then move to Boston where he started working as an editor for a magazine. While in Boston, Poe met Charles Dickens who highly recommended that he start writing fiction. And so he did.</p>
<p>Many famous works including “The Raven” and “The Pit and the Pendulum” were published during his lifetime but unfortunately, he never saw much monetary success from his writing. In fact, he often resorted to gambling in order to make ends meet. It was during one such instance that he ran up quite a debt at a gaming table and was subsequently forced to flee town. He would later find himself penniless in Baltimore where he died at the age of 40 under mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p>Even though Allan Poe faced many hardships throughout his life, he persevered and is today considered one of the most influential authors in American history.</p>
<h1 id="Bankruptcy-Proceedings-Filed-Against-Author-Allen-Poe-After-Failed-Gambling-Venture"><a href="#Bankruptcy-Proceedings-Filed-Against-Author-Allen-Poe-After-Failed-Gambling-Venture" class="headerlink" title="Bankruptcy Proceedings Filed Against Author Allen Poe After Failed Gambling Venture"></a>Bankruptcy Proceedings Filed Against Author Allen Poe After Failed Gambling Venture</h1><p>On January 15th, 2019, author Allen Poe filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The decision came after a failed investment in a casino venture in Atlantic City. Documents filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey show that Poe owes $1.4 million to more than two dozen creditors.</p>
<p>The assets listed in Poe’s bankruptcy filing are modest, totaling just over $38,000. Included in that amount is a $32,000 home in Pittsburgh and a 2006 Ford Focus with approximately 78,000 miles on it.</p>
<p>Poe’s largest creditor is the United States government, which is owed more than $827,000 in taxes. Other major debtors include the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue ($115,000), PNC Bank ($108,000), and Warner Bros. Entertainment ($103,000).</p>
<p>In a statement released to the press, Poe said he was “devastated” by the failure of his gambling venture but felt “forced” to file for bankruptcy given the scale of his debts. He vowed to repay his creditors “to the best of my ability” and expressed hope that he could still “write great books that people will love.”</p>
<p>This is not Poe’s first brush with financial trouble. In 2015, he declared personal bankruptcy after racking up more than $700,000 in debt from credit card purchases and home renovations.</p>
<p>Poe is best known for his short stories and poems, including “The Tell-Tale Heart” and “The Raven.” He has published numerous books over the course of his career and won several awards, including the Edgar Award for Best Novel in 2014 for his work “The Silkworm.”</p>

        <h1 id="South-Carolina-Gambling-Laws-Questioned-After-Flap-Over-Horse-Track"><a href="#South-Carolina-Gambling-Laws-Questioned-After-Flap-Over-Horse-Track" class="headerlink" title="South Carolina Gambling Laws Questioned After Flap Over Horse Track"></a>South Carolina Gambling Laws Questioned After Flap Over Horse Track</h1><p>On January 11, 2018, the people of South Carolina found themselves at the center of a gambling controversy when state regulators abruptly shut down Harrah’s Cherokee Casino Resort near the North Carolina border. The casino, which is owned and operated by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, had been in operation for over a year without issue. But on January 11, state regulators showed up and closed the casino, telling its employees that they were no longer allowed to work there.</p>
<p>The shutdown came as a surprise to many people in South Carolina. The state has long been home to numerous horse tracks and other forms of gambling, and no one had ever complained about Harrah’s Cherokee Casino Resort before. In fact, many people saw the casino as a much-needed economic boon for the region.</p>
<p>So what led to the shutdown? Apparently, state regulators were worried that the casino was violating South Carolina gambling laws. Specifically, they were concerned that the casino was operating too close to North Carolina’s borders.</p>
<p>This concern may seem silly to some people, but it’s actually a valid concern under South Carolina law. The state has a longstanding ban on gambling within its borders, and it’s concerned about casinos opening up too close to its borders. This is why there are so many casinos in neighboring states like Georgia and North Carolina – they can operate without violating South Carolina law.</p>
<p>Of course, this issue is far from resolved. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has already filed a lawsuit against the state of South Carolina, and the case is currently pending in federal court. So stay tuned – this story is sure to continue making headlines in the months ahead.</p>
<h1 id="South-Carolina-Lawmakers-Consider-Changing-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#South-Carolina-Lawmakers-Consider-Changing-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="South Carolina Lawmakers Consider Changing Gambling Laws"></a>South Carolina Lawmakers Consider Changing Gambling Laws</h1><p>A recent bill in the South Carolina state legislature is looking to change the gambling laws in the state. The proposed law would allow for more widespread gambling, including authorizing casinos and betting on horse races. The move has been met with criticism from some residents and lawmakers, who argue that it will lead to increased crime and social ills. Proponents of the change say that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state, and that the current laws are too restrictive.</p>
<p>The issue of gambling is a controversial one, with strong arguments on both sides. Some people feel that it is morally wrong to gamble, while others see it as a form of entertainment. There are also practical concerns about gambling, such as its potential for addiction and its effects on society.</p>
<p>Proponents of changing South Carolina’s gambling laws argue that the revenue generated could be used to help state coffers. They also maintain that there are strict regulations in place to prevent problem gambling. However, others argue that casino gaming can be addictive and lead to crime and other social ills. They also claim that expansion of gambling will benefit only a small number of people while putting the public at risk.</p>
<p>So what is the right thing to do? Is it better to have more or fewer gambling options? It’s not an easy question to answer, and there are valid arguments on both sides. Ultimately, it may come down to what each individual feels is best for their state.</p>
<h1 id="Pro-Gambling-Group-Emerges-in-South-Carolina"><a href="#Pro-Gambling-Group-Emerges-in-South-Carolina" class="headerlink" title="Pro-Gambling Group Emerges in South Carolina"></a>Pro-Gambling Group Emerges in South Carolina</h1><p>A new pro-gambling group has emerged in South Carolina, hoping to convince state lawmakers to legalize some form of gambling.</p>
<p>The group, called Palmetto Citizens for Gambling Reform, is led by John Warren, a former member of the state House of Representatives. Warren resigned from his seat in 2013 after he was caught running an illegal gambling ring.</p>
<p>Now, Warren is hoping to use his experience to help legalize gambling in the state. “After years of watching other states benefit from this industry, I believe it’s time for South Carolina to get on board,” he said.</p>
<p>So far, the group has failed to gain much traction in the state legislature. But that may change soon, as lawmakers are considering a proposal that would allow limited forms of casino gambling.</p>
<p>The proposal would allow three casinos to be built in the state, and would allow residents to place bets online. It’s not clear if the proposal will pass, but it’s clear that there is growing support for legalized gambling in South Carolina.</p>
<h1 id="GTECH-Not-Giving-Up-on-SC-Gambling-Market"><a href="#GTECH-Not-Giving-Up-on-SC-Gambling-Market" class="headerlink" title="GTECH Not Giving Up on SC Gambling Market"></a>GTECH Not Giving Up on SC Gambling Market</h1><p>GTECH Corporation has been in the gambling industry for over 40 years, and they show no signs of slowing down. Recently, the company has been expanding their operations into the South Carolina gambling market.</p>
<p>The company is currently running a trial of its online sports betting platform with the Walterboro Racing Club. GTECH plans to offer both online and land-based sports betting in the state once regulations are in place.</p>
<p>The aim of this expansion is to tap into the burgeoning South Carolina gambling market. In 2018, casino revenue totaled $827 million, a 9.7% increase from the previous year. The majority of this revenue comes from residents of Charleston and Columbia, which are two of the largest cities in the state.</p>
<p>GTECH isn’t new to the South Carolina gambling market; they have been providing lottery services since 1992. However, this is their first foray into sports betting.</p>
<p>The Walterboro Racing Club is a small track located about an hour north of Charleston. The track only offers live racing five days a week during the summer months. GTECH’s online sports betting platform will allow bettors to bet on races from around the country.</p>
<p>According to GTECH spokesperson, Patti Doyle, “This is just one example of our commitment to meet customer demand for a safe and legal integrated betting experience across all channels – retail, online, mobile and digital self-service kiosks”.</p>
<p>It’s unclear exactly when regulations will be in place for online sports betting in South Carolina, but GTECH is ready to capitalize on the opportunity as soon as they are allowed to do so.</p>
<h1 id="Legalized-Gambling-Could-Bring-Millions-to-South-Carolina"><a href="#Legalized-Gambling-Could-Bring-Millions-to-South-Carolina" class="headerlink" title="Legalized Gambling Could Bring Millions to South Carolina"></a>Legalized Gambling Could Bring Millions to South Carolina</h1><p>A new study suggests that legalizing gambling could bring in $1.1 billion for South Carolina over the next decade. The Palmetto State is one of only a handful of states without any form of legalized gambling, but that could be changing soon.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business, says that if gambling is legalized, the state could see an influx of tourists and new jobs. The casino industry is worth an estimated $240 billion nationally, and South Carolina could capture a portion of that market by legalizing various forms of gambling.</p>
<p>Revenue from gambling would be used to fund education and other important programs in the state. Opponents of legalized gambling say that it would lead to addiction and social ills, but supporters say that those problems already exist in the state and are not related to legalized gambling.</p>
<p>Gambling has been illegal in South Carolina for decades, but that may be about to change. A bill introduced in the state legislature would legalize casinos, poker rooms, and other forms of gambling. The bill has passed the House and is now pending in the Senate.</p>
<p>If the bill becomes law, it will be up to the voters to decide whether to approve casino gambling in a referendum. If they do, up to seven casinos could be built in the state. supporters say that legalizing gambling would create thousands of jobs and bring millions of dollars into the state economy.</p>

        <h1 id="Golf-Gambling-is-Booming-Worldwide"><a href="#Golf-Gambling-is-Booming-Worldwide" class="headerlink" title="Golf Gambling is Booming Worldwide"></a>Golf Gambling is Booming Worldwide</h1><p>Golf is one of the most popular sports in the world, enjoyed by people of all ages and genders. And now, thanks to its growing popularity as a gambling sport, it’s becoming an ever more important part of the global gambling industry. In this article we take a look at why golf gambling is booming worldwide, and some of the key markets where it’s thriving.</p>
<p>One reason for golf’s surging popularity as a gambling sport is that it offers plenty of opportunities for big wins. Unlike sports like football or rugby, where outcomes are often determined by factors outside of the players’ control (such as luck or injuries), in golf the outcome often depends on the players’ own skills and abilities. This makes it possible to bet on matches with a high degree of confidence, knowing that the better player has a good chance of winning.</p>
<p>Another key factor driving the growth of golf gambling is its international appeal. Golf is played in over 100 countries worldwide, giving bettors a huge range of potential betting opportunities. And with tournaments taking place all over the globe, there’s always something exciting happening in the world of golf gambling.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest markets for golf gambling include the UK, Ireland and South Africa. The UK is home to several major golf tournaments each year, including The Open and The Masters, while Ireland is well-known for its lively betting culture when it comes to golf matches. South Africa is also experiencing strong growth in golf betting, with many locals making use of online bookmakers to place wagers on upcoming tournaments.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some excitement in your life, why not take a punt on some golf action? There are plenty of great betting opportunities out there, so don’t miss out!</p>
<h1 id="Golfers-Love-a-Good-Gamble-Especially-When-They-Win"><a href="#Golfers-Love-a-Good-Gamble-Especially-When-They-Win" class="headerlink" title="Golfers Love a Good Gamble, Especially When They Win!"></a>Golfers Love a Good Gamble, Especially When They Win!</h1><p>Golfers are often considered some of the most financially savvy people on the planet. This is likely because gambling is such an important part of the game. From betting on who will win to playing for side bets, golfers really love to gamble.</p>
<p>And it’s not just a small wager here and there. Professional golfers have been known to bet hundreds of thousands of dollars on a single hole. And it’s not just the money they’re risking either. Reputations can be on the line as well.</p>
<p>In one famous story, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods were playing in a practice round for an upcoming tournament. They were both on the green with putters in their hands, when Tiger decided to place a $200 bet on who would make their putt first. Phil was up and he made his putt, so Tiger had to pay up.</p>
<p>This type of wagering is common among golfers, but it’s not just about winning money. Many golfers also enjoy the challenge of trying to beat someone else. This is why many golfers will place side bets with their friends or fellow competitors. Some common side bets include things like longest drive, closest to the pin, and even who can get out of a sand trap first.</p>
<p>So why do golfers love to gamble so much? The answer is simple: they enjoy the thrill of taking a risk and hopefully winning big. And when they do win, it just makes the game that much more enjoyable!</p>
<h1 id="More-and-More-Golfers-are-Turning-to-Gambling-to-Make-Their-Games-More-Exciting"><a href="#More-and-More-Golfers-are-Turning-to-Gambling-to-Make-Their-Games-More-Exciting" class="headerlink" title="More and More Golfers are Turning to Gambling to Make Their Games More Exciting"></a>More and More Golfers are Turning to Gambling to Make Their Games More Exciting</h1><p>Golf is a sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is a challenging game that can be played in many different places. While golf may be seen as a boring sport to some, others find it exciting and thrilling. This is especially true for those who enjoy gambling. In recent years, an increasing number of golfers have been turning to gambling in order to make their games more exciting.</p>
<p>There are many different types of gambling that can be used when playing golf. Some people enjoy betting on the outcome of the game while others enjoy playing casino games on the course. There are even some people who enjoy taking part in poker tournaments while playing golf. No matter what type of gambling you enjoy, there is sure to be a way to incorporate it into your next round of golf.</p>
<p>If you are new to gambling, there are a few things you need to know before you get started. The first thing you need to do is find a reputable gaming site. There are many different sites available, so it is important to do your research before choosing one. Make sure the site you choose is licensed and regulated by a respected authority. This will help ensure that your money is safe and that you will receive any payouts you are entitled to.</p>
<p>The second thing you need to do is choose the right type of bet for you. There are many different bets available, so it is important to find one that suits your interests and budget. If you are new to gambling, it may be wise to start with simple bets until you become more comfortable with the process.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen a site and made your bets, it is time to start playing golf! When playing golf, keep an eye out for opportunities to place your bets. If you see someone miss a shot or putt, this may be the perfect time to place a bet on the outcome of the game. Just make sure you don’t get too caught up in the excitement of gambling and lose focus on the game itself!</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-on-Golf-is-as-Popular-as-it-hasEver-Been"><a href="#Gambling-on-Golf-is-as-Popular-as-it-hasEver-Been" class="headerlink" title="Gambling on Golf is as Popular as it hasEver Been"></a>Gambling on Golf is as Popular as it hasEver Been</h1><p>Golf is one of the most popular sports in the world and also one of the most gambled on. Whether its professional or amateur tournaments, or simply a round amongst friends, there’s always money exchanging hands when it comes to betting on golf.</p>
<p>There are a variety of bets one can make when gambling on golf. The simplest is simply picking who will win the match or tournament. Another common bet is the “head-to-head”, where two players are pitted against each other and you bet which one will come out on top. There are also many prop bets available, such as which player will make the first birdie or even what color shirt the winning golfer will be wearing.</p>
<p>No matter what type of bet you decide to make, there’s no doubt that gambling on golf provides plenty of excitement. And with so many opportunities for big payouts, it’s no wonder why this pastime is so popular.</p>
<h1 id="Golf-Betting-is-now-Bigger-than-Ever"><a href="#Golf-Betting-is-now-Bigger-than-Ever" class="headerlink" title="Golf Betting is now Bigger than Ever"></a>Golf Betting is now Bigger than Ever</h1><p>Golf betting has exploded in popularity in recent years, as punters have latched onto the opportunity to make some easy money by backing their favourite players. The market is now bigger than ever, with a wide range of golf betting options available for those who know where to look.</p>
<p>In this article, we will take a look at some of the most popular golf betting markets and explain how they work. We will also provide some tips on how to make money from golf betting, so that you can start making a profit today.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the most basic form of golf betting: match-betting. In a match-bet, you are predicting which player will win a specific golf match. This can be between two players or two pairs of players.</p>
<p>The odds for this type of bet will vary depending on the relative strengths of the players involved. For example, if two novice players are playing each other, then the odds might be fairly even. However, if Tiger Woods is playing against someone who has never won a major tournament, then Tiger would be a heavy favourite to win.</p>
<p>To win a match-bet, your selected player simply needs to win the match. If they finish level after 18 holes (or more), then you lose your bet.</p>
<p>Another popular golf betting market is predicting who will finish in first place out of a group of players. In this type of bet, you are predicting which player will finish ahead of all others in their group. The odds for this bet vary depending on the strength of the field and on how many players are in the group.</p>
<p>The winner of this type of bet is the player who finishes first out of all other players in their group, regardless of how many holes they lead by at the end of the tournament. If there is a tie for first place, then your bet is void and you get your money back.</p>
<p> outright betting is another popular option when it comes to golf betting. In an outright bet, you are predicting which player or team will win a specific event (e.g The Masters). The odds for this type of bet vary depending on the quality of the field and on who is competing in the event.</p>
<p>To win an outright bet, your selected player or team simply needs to win the event in question. If they come second or worse, you lose your bet.</p>

The game has been downloaded more than 10 million times and it has a rating of 4.6 stars on the App Store.</p>
<p>Prosperity Dragon is a simple game where players need to tap on the dragon to earn gold. The gold can then be used to purchase items, such as buildings and decorations. The game also features a unique breeding system, which allows players to breed different dragon combinations in order to create powerful new dragons.</p>
<p>While the game is available in most countries, it is actually illegal in China. The Chinese government has labeled Prosperity Dragon as an “unhealthy game” and it has been banned from being played in China. This isn’t too surprising, as many idle games have been banned in China due to their addictive nature.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Prosperity Dragon is illegal in China, it is still one of the most popular idle games on the App Store and Google Play. This could be due to its high quality graphics, simple gameplay mechanics, and addictive nature.</p>
<h1 id="Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-a-Scam"><a href="#Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-a-Scam" class="headerlink" title="Prosperity Dragon Game is a Scam"></a>Prosperity Dragon Game is a Scam</h1><p>Prosperity Dragon Game is a fraudulent app that has been created with the sole purpose of stealing people’s money. This app promises to help users make money, but in reality it just takes their hard-earned cash.</p>
<p>Prosperity Dragon Game uses deceptive tactics to lure people into signing up for its services. It claims that users can make profits of $10,000 a day just by using the app, but this is simply not true. The only people who make money from Prosperity Dragon Game are the creators of the app, who scam people out of their hard-earned cash.</p>
<p>People should avoid this app at all cost, as it will only result in them losing money. There are plenty of other legitimate apps available that can help users make money, so there is no need to risk your money on Prosperity Dragon Game.</p>
<h1 id="Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-Rigged"><a href="#Prosperity-Dragon-Game-is-Rigged" class="headerlink" title="Prosperity Dragon Game is Rigged"></a>Prosperity Dragon Game is Rigged</h1><p>The Prosperity Dragon game by Plarium is a digital collectible card game (CCG) for Android and iOS devices. In the game, players battle against each other using dragons and magical creatures to earn rewards. Some players have accused the game of being rigged, specifically in regards to the cards that are offered as rewards.</p>
<p>Players have complained that they never seem to get the good cards from battles, while others seem to always win the best cards. This has caused some players to accuse Plarium of rigging the game in order to give an advantage to those who spend money on it. While there is no definitive answer as to whether or not the game is rigged, it does seem suspicious that some players always manage to get the best cards while others struggle.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a fair and balanced CCG, Prosperity Dragon may not be the game for you. If you’re willing to take the risk of possibly being ripped off, then you may enjoy this game. Just be aware that there is a possibility that you may not get a fair chance at winning.</p>

<p>The Prosperity Dragon game is a mobile app that allows users to earn money by breeding and raising virtual dragons. The game has become very popular in Cameroon, with over 1 million users. However, authorities believe that the game is being used to launder money.</p>
<p>According to authorities, criminals are using the game to move money around without being detected. They believe that the criminals are using fake accounts to launder money.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the Cameroonian government has decided to shut down the game. They have also warned all of the players of the game that they could face criminal charges if they are found to be involved in money laundering.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a mobile app has been used to launder money. In 2016, authorities in China shut down a mobile app called “Colorful Balloons” because it was being used to launder money.</p>

The game, which is available on both iOS and Facebook platforms, has been around for six years and has continued to gain popularity.</p>
<p>The purpose of the game is to help the dragon grow prosperous by gathering coins and artifacts. Players can also hatch eggs and raise dragons. However, with each round lasting only a few minutes, it’s easy for players to get lost in the game and lose track of time and money.</p>
<p>In addition to the $1 billion lost by players, app developers have also made millions in revenue from the game. In fact, the app was recently ranked as one of the highest grossing apps on both iTunes and Facebook.</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-Claim-Gambling-Winnings-as-a-Non-Resident-Alien"><a href="#How-to-Claim-Gambling-Winnings-as-a-Non-Resident-Alien" class="headerlink" title="How to Claim Gambling Winnings as a Non-Resident Alien"></a>How to Claim Gambling Winnings as a Non-Resident Alien</h1><p>As a non-resident alien, there are a couple of things you need to do in order to claim gambling winnings as tax-free income. The first step is to make sure that the gambling activity is considered a “trade or business” for tax purposes. This generally includes activities like casino gaming, horse racing, and betting on sporting events.</p>
<p>If you can establish that your gambling activity is a trade or business, you will need to report your winnings on Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business). You can then subtract any losses from your winnings to arrive at your net taxable income. Any taxes owed on this income will be deferred until you file your annual return.</p>
<p>If your gambling activity does not rise to the level of a trade or business, you will still need to report your winnings on Form 1040, but they will be treated as taxable income. You can deduct any gambling losses from your winnings, but only up to the amount of taxable income generated by the wins. This means that any losses in excess of your taxable income will not be deductible.</p>
<p>In either case, it is important to keep track of your gambling wins and losses throughout the year so that you can accurately report them on your tax return. You should also retain documentation such as receipts, tickets, or other records verifying the amount of your winnings and losses.</p>
<h1 id="Claim-Your-Gambling-Winnings-As-A-Non-Resident-Alien"><a href="#Claim-Your-Gambling-Winnings-As-A-Non-Resident-Alien" class="headerlink" title="Claim Your Gambling Winnings As A Non-Resident Alien"></a>Claim Your Gambling Winnings As A Non-Resident Alien</h1><p>Are you a non-resident alien (NRA) and have won money gambling? The good news is that you may be able to claim your gambling winnings as tax-free income!</p>
<p>In order to qualify for this tax break, you must meet certain requirements. First, you must gambling in a foreign country. This means that any winnings from gambling in the United States are not eligible. Second, you must declare all of your winnings on your tax return. Finally, you must have a valid social security number or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN).</p>
<p>If you meet all of these requirements, you can claim your gambling winnings as exempt from US taxes. This can be a huge tax break, so it’s important to make sure you qualify. For more information on claiming your gambling winnings as a NRA, consult a tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-avoid-taxes-on-gambling-winnings-as-a-non-resident-alien"><a href="#How-to-avoid-taxes-on-gambling-winnings-as-a-non-resident-alien" class="headerlink" title="How to avoid taxes on gambling winnings as a non-resident alien"></a>How to avoid taxes on gambling winnings as a non-resident alien</h1><p>As a non-resident alien, there are a few ways to avoid taxes on gambling winnings. Some of these methods include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reporting the gambling income on form 1040NR, rather than form 1040.</li>
<li>Including the gambling losses as itemized deductions on Schedule A, Form 1040NR. This can be done up to the amount of the gambling income. </li>
<li>Claiming exemption from U.S. taxation under a tax treaty between the U.S. and your country of residence. </li>
<li>Filing an income tax return in your country of residence and reporting the gambling income on that return.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are able to use one of these methods, it is important to keep accurate records of your gambling income and losses. This information can be used to support your tax return when it is filed.</p>

To claim your gambling losses, you will need to report your winnings and losses separately.</p>
<p>To report your gambling winnings, you will need to complete Form 1040, Schedule A. This form is used to report itemized deductions. In addition to your gambling losses, you can also claim other deductions such as mortgage interest, taxes, and charitable contributions.</p>
<p>To report your gambling losses, you will need to complete Form 1040, Schedule C-EZ. This form is used to report net earnings from self-employment. In addition to your gambling losses, you can also claim business expenses such as travel and advertising expenses.</p>
<p>You cannot deduct your gambling losses if you do not report the winnings. You should keep track of all of your winnings and losses throughout the year in order to accurately calculate your deduction.</p>
<h1 id="Can-I-Claim-My-Gambling-Losses-If-I-Am-A-Non-Resident-Alien"><a href="#Can-I-Claim-My-Gambling-Losses-If-I-Am-A-Non-Resident-Alien" class="headerlink" title="Can I Claim My Gambling Losses If I Am A Non-Resident Alien?"></a>Can I Claim My Gambling Losses If I Am A Non-Resident Alien?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling losses and taxation, there are a few things that Non-Resident Aliens (NRAs) need to take into account. We’ll go over some of the basics of gambling taxation and what you need to do in order to claim your losses.</p>
<p>Generally, NRAs are subject to the same rules as resident aliens when it comes to gambling income and losses. This means that money won while gambling is taxable and money lost is deductible. However, there are a couple of specificities that apply specifically to NRAs.</p>
<p>First, in order to claim your gambling losses, you must have documentation of those losses. This can be in the form of tickets, statements from the casino or other evidence of how much you lost. Without this documentation, the IRS will not allow you to claim your losses.</p>
<p>Second, if you are a NRA living outside of the United States, you may be able to deduct your gambling losses on your nonresident alien tax return. However, this deduction is only allowed if you itemize your deductions on your tax return. If you choose not to itemize deductions, then you cannot claim your gambling losses.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that these rules apply only to gambling income and losses incurred while gambling within the United States. Gambling income or losses incurred while gambling outside of the US are not subject to US taxation.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how gambling affects your taxes as an NRA, be sure to check with a qualified tax professional.</p>

        <h1 id="Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino-Closes-Doors-After-26-Years-In-Business"><a href="#Trump-Taj-Mahal-Casino-Closes-Doors-After-26-Years-In-Business" class="headerlink" title="Trump Taj Mahal Casino Closes Doors After 26 Years In Business"></a>Trump Taj Mahal Casino Closes Doors After 26 Years In Business</h1><p>The Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has closed its doors after 26 years in business.</p>
<p>The casino, which was originally opened by Donald Trump in 1990, filed for bankruptcy for the fourth time in 2014 and was taken over by billionaire Carl Icahn. In October of 2016, Icahn announced that he would be closing the casino due to failed negotiations with union workers.</p>
<p>Most of the casino’s 3,000 employees were given notice in October that their jobs would be terminated on December 12th. However, union workers continued to negotiate with Icahn in hopes of keeping the casino open. On Sunday, November 13th, those negotiations failed and the casino closed its doors.</p>
<p>Former Trump Taj Mahal employees expressed disappointment at the closure. Many had been with the casino since it opened and had hoped to retire from there. Some employees even staged a protest outside the building on Sunday.</p>
<p>Trump Taj Mahal is one of five casinos to close in Atlantic City since 2014.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-Gambling-Age-To-Remain-At-18-After-Trump-Taj-Mahal-Closure"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Gambling-Age-To-Remain-At-18-After-Trump-Taj-Mahal-Closure" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Gambling Age To Remain At 18 After Trump Taj Mahal Closure"></a>Atlantic City Gambling Age To Remain At 18 After Trump Taj Mahal Closure</h1><p>The Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City will close its doors after Labor Day, according to the company’s president. This will leave about 3,000 workers without a job.</p>
<p>The closure of the casino is a major blow to Atlantic City, which is already struggling economically. The Trump Taj Mahal is one of the city’s largest employers.</p>
<p>In response to the closure, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has said that the state’s gambling age will not be raised from 18 to 21. This is good news for young people who enjoy gambling and for the businesses that rely on them.</p>
<p>Raising the gambling age would have been a major blow to Atlantic City’s economy. It would have resulted in the loss of jobs and tax revenue.</p>
<p>The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal is also a reminder that Atlantic City is in serious trouble. The city has been struggling since casinos started moving to other states a few years ago.</p>
<p>Atlantic City officials are hoping that a referendum on November 8th will help revive the city’s economy. The referendum would allow two new casinos to be built in Atlantic City.</p>
<h1 id="Fifth-Casino-Closes-in-AC-Leaving-Thousands-Unemployed"><a href="#Fifth-Casino-Closes-in-AC-Leaving-Thousands-Unemployed" class="headerlink" title="Fifth Casino Closes in AC, Leaving Thousands Unemployed"></a>Fifth Casino Closes in AC, Leaving Thousands Unemployed</h1><p>The Atlantic City casino industry took another hard hit this week when the fifth casino announced it would be closing its doors. This leaves thousands of employees out of work, just as the Christmas season starts.</p>
<p>The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal is a major blow to both the city and the state of New Jersey. The casino was one of the largest in Atlantic City, and its closure leaves a gaping hole in the city’s economy.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of closures that has hit the city hard. In recent years, four other casinos have closed, putting more than 10,000 people out of work.</p>
<p>The closures are a direct result of increased competition from casinos in neighboring states. Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland all have casinos that are siphoning business away from Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Casino supporters had been hoping that a new bill that would allow gambling in North Jersey would help revive the industry. But that bill appears to be stalled in the legislature, and there is no sign that it will be passed anytime soon.</p>
<p>The future looks bleak for Atlantic City’s casino industry. Unless something is done to bolster the industry, more casinos will likely close in the coming years. This will leave thousands more people unemployed and struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<h1 id="Future-of-Gambling-Age-in-Atlantic-City-Remains-Uncertain-After-Fifth-Casino-Closure"><a href="#Future-of-Gambling-Age-in-Atlantic-City-Remains-Uncertain-After-Fifth-Casino-Closure" class="headerlink" title="Future of Gambling Age in Atlantic City Remains Uncertain After Fifth Casino Closure"></a>Future of Gambling Age in Atlantic City Remains Uncertain After Fifth Casino Closure</h1><p>Atlantic City, long known as the gambling capital of the east coast, is facing an uncertain future after the closure of its fifth casino in less than a year. The closure of the $2.4 billion Revel casino has left nearly 4000 employees out of work and raised questions about the future of gambling in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s gaming industry has been in decline for years, as consumers have been flocking to casinos in neighboring states. The crumbling casino industry has had a devastating effect on Atlantic City’s economy, leading to high unemployment and poverty rates.</p>
<p>The closure of Revel leaves just 8 casinos operating in Atlantic City, and many are worried that more casinos will soon close their doors. This may not be great news for casino operators either, as revenue from gambling is dropping rapidly. In 2013, gambling revenue from Atlantic City’s casinos totaled $2.86 billion, down from $3.9 billion in 2007.</p>
<p>So what is the future of gambling in Atlantic City? It remains uncertain. Some experts believe that some smaller casinos may close down in the next few years, while others believe that the industry will stabilize and eventually rebound. However, it is clear that Atlantic City’s days as the gambling capital of the east coast are numbered.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City’s-Gambling-Age-Remains-at-18-as-Another-Casino-Closes"><a href="#Atlantic-City’s-Gambling-Age-Remains-at-18-as-Another-Casino-Closes" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City’s Gambling Age Remains at 18 as Another Casino Closes"></a>Atlantic City’s Gambling Age Remains at 18 as Another Casino Closes</h1><p>Atlantic City’s Gambling Age Remains at 18 as Another Casino Closes</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s gambling age remains at 18, despite the closure of another casino in the city.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Club casino, which closed its doors on January 13, was the first to close in Atlantic City in over two decades. The casino is just one of the 12 casinos currently open in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The news of the closure has led some to call for an increase in the gambling age from 18 to 21. However, New Jersey state senator Jim Whelan has said that he does not support such a measure.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it would be wise to change the age now,” Whelan said. “But we’ll have to wait and see what happens.”</p>
<p>The closure of The Atlantic Club has already had a negative impact on employment in the area, with over 1,000 employees losing their jobs.</p>
