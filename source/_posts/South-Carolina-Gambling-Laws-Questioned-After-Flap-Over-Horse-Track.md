#  South Carolina Gambling Laws Questioned After Flap Over Horse Track

On January 11, 2018, the people of South Carolina found themselves at the center of a gambling controversy when state regulators abruptly shut down Harrah’s Cherokee Casino Resort near the North Carolina border. The casino, which is owned and operated by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, had been in operation for over a year without issue. But on January 11, state regulators showed up and closed the casino, telling its employees that they were no longer allowed to work there.

The shutdown came as a surprise to many people in South Carolina. The state has long been home to numerous horse tracks and other forms of gambling, and no one had ever complained about Harrah’s Cherokee Casino Resort before. In fact, many people saw the casino as a much-needed economic boon for the region.

So what led to the shutdown? Apparently, state regulators were worried that the casino was violating South Carolina gambling laws. Specifically, they were concerned that the casino was operating too close to North Carolina’s borders.

This concern may seem silly to some people, but it’s actually a valid concern under South Carolina law. The state has a longstanding ban on gambling within its borders, and it’s concerned about casinos opening up too close to its borders. This is why there are so many casinos in neighboring states like Georgia and North Carolina – they can operate without violating South Carolina law.

Of course, this issue is far from resolved. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has already filed a lawsuit against the state of South Carolina, and the case is currently pending in federal court. So stay tuned – this story is sure to continue making headlines in the months ahead.

#  South Carolina Lawmakers Consider Changing Gambling Laws

A recent bill in the South Carolina state legislature is looking to change the gambling laws in the state. The proposed law would allow for more widespread gambling, including authorizing casinos and betting on horse races. The move has been met with criticism from some residents and lawmakers, who argue that it will lead to increased crime and social ills. Proponents of the change say that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state, and that the current laws are too restrictive.

The issue of gambling is a controversial one, with strong arguments on both sides. Some people feel that it is morally wrong to gamble, while others see it as a form of entertainment. There are also practical concerns about gambling, such as its potential for addiction and its effects on society.

Proponents of changing South Carolina's gambling laws argue that the revenue generated could be used to help state coffers. They also maintain that there are strict regulations in place to prevent problem gambling. However, others argue that casino gaming can be addictive and lead to crime and other social ills. They also claim that expansion of gambling will benefit only a small number of people while putting the public at risk.

So what is the right thing to do? Is it better to have more or fewer gambling options? It's not an easy question to answer, and there are valid arguments on both sides. Ultimately, it may come down to what each individual feels is best for their state.

#  Pro-Gambling Group Emerges in South Carolina

A new pro-gambling group has emerged in South Carolina, hoping to convince state lawmakers to legalize some form of gambling.

The group, called Palmetto Citizens for Gambling Reform, is led by John Warren, a former member of the state House of Representatives. Warren resigned from his seat in 2013 after he was caught running an illegal gambling ring.

Now, Warren is hoping to use his experience to help legalize gambling in the state. "After years of watching other states benefit from this industry, I believe it's time for South Carolina to get on board," he said.

So far, the group has failed to gain much traction in the state legislature. But that may change soon, as lawmakers are considering a proposal that would allow limited forms of casino gambling.

The proposal would allow three casinos to be built in the state, and would allow residents to place bets online. It's not clear if the proposal will pass, but it's clear that there is growing support for legalized gambling in South Carolina.

#  GTECH Not Giving Up on SC Gambling Market

GTECH Corporation has been in the gambling industry for over 40 years, and they show no signs of slowing down. Recently, the company has been expanding their operations into the South Carolina gambling market.

The company is currently running a trial of its online sports betting platform with the Walterboro Racing Club. GTECH plans to offer both online and land-based sports betting in the state once regulations are in place.

The aim of this expansion is to tap into the burgeoning South Carolina gambling market. In 2018, casino revenue totaled $827 million, a 9.7% increase from the previous year. The majority of this revenue comes from residents of Charleston and Columbia, which are two of the largest cities in the state.

GTECH isn’t new to the South Carolina gambling market; they have been providing lottery services since 1992. However, this is their first foray into sports betting.

The Walterboro Racing Club is a small track located about an hour north of Charleston. The track only offers live racing five days a week during the summer months. GTECH’s online sports betting platform will allow bettors to bet on races from around the country.

According to GTECH spokesperson, Patti Doyle, “This is just one example of our commitment to meet customer demand for a safe and legal integrated betting experience across all channels – retail, online, mobile and digital self-service kiosks”.

It’s unclear exactly when regulations will be in place for online sports betting in South Carolina, but GTECH is ready to capitalize on the opportunity as soon as they are allowed to do so.

#  Legalized Gambling Could Bring Millions to South Carolina

A new study suggests that legalizing gambling could bring in $1.1 billion for South Carolina over the next decade. The Palmetto State is one of only a handful of states without any form of legalized gambling, but that could be changing soon.

The study, conducted by the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business, says that if gambling is legalized, the state could see an influx of tourists and new jobs. The casino industry is worth an estimated $240 billion nationally, and South Carolina could capture a portion of that market by legalizing various forms of gambling.

Revenue from gambling would be used to fund education and other important programs in the state. Opponents of legalized gambling say that it would lead to addiction and social ills, but supporters say that those problems already exist in the state and are not related to legalized gambling.

Gambling has been illegal in South Carolina for decades, but that may be about to change. A bill introduced in the state legislature would legalize casinos, poker rooms, and other forms of gambling. The bill has passed the House and is now pending in the Senate.

If the bill becomes law, it will be up to the voters to decide whether to approve casino gambling in a referendum. If they do, up to seven casinos could be built in the state. supporters say that legalizing gambling would create thousands of jobs and bring millions of dollars into the state economy.
