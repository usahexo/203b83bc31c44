#  Soccer Fans Could be in for a Tax Surprise

As soccer season kicks into high gear, many fans could be in for a tax surprise.

While some may think that buying tickets to a game or spending money on related gear is a deductible expense, that’s not always the case.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) states that tickets to sporting events are considered a personal expense and are not deductible. Expenses related to jerseys, hats, and other team apparel are also not deductible.

However, there are some exceptions. If the expenses are related to travel and accommodations in order to attend a game or if they are incurred as part of a business venture, then they may be deductible.

#  How Much Will You Get Taxed on your Slot Machine Winnings?

When you go to a casino, you may be thinking about what games you want to play and how much money you can win. But before you start spending your hard-earned cash, it's important to know what taxes may be owed on any prizes or winnings.

The good news is that, in most cases, the amounts won from slot machines are not taxable. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule.

For starters, if you live in the United States and win over $1,200 from a slot machine, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will require you to report those earnings as taxable income. In addition, if you happen to win $5,000 or more from slots in a single day, that amount will also be taxed by the IRS.

And if you're lucky enough to take home a jackpot prize from a slot machine? Well, that windfall is subject to federal and state taxes. For example, in Nevada winners of more than $1,000 must pay both state and federal taxes on their prize money.

So while it's generally true that slot machine winnings are not taxable in most cases, it's always best to check with an accountant or tax specialist to be sure. After all, nothing spoils the fun of winning like having to write a big check to the government!

#  Soccer World Cup: How Taxable are your Winnings?

The soccer World Cup is one of the world’s most-watched sporting events. Held every four years in a different country, it has captured the hearts and minds of fans around the globe. While some people tune in for the love of the game, others are motivated by the prospect of winning big.

If you’re one of those lucky few who manages to pick a winner, you may be wondering how taxable your winnings are. The answer depends on a number of factors, including where you live and what type of bet you placed.

In general, gambling winnings are considered taxable income in most countries. However, there are often exemptions for small wins or those that are considered to be “incidental” to regular gambling activities.

For example, in Canada gambling winnings over $10 are considered taxable income. However, if you only win a small amount and it’s not related to your regular gambling activity, then you may not have to pay any taxes on it.

In the United States, gambling winnings are subject to federal income tax withholding. The amount withheld depends on your marital status and whether you have other withholding allowances. Generally speaking, however, gambling winnings over $5,000 are subject to withholding.

If you live in the United Kingdom, your gambling winnings are subject to both income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs). The rate at which you pay income tax depends on your income level and whether you’re a resident or non-resident gambler. NICs are currently charged at 12% for most people.

As you can see, the tax treatment of gambling winnings varies from country to country. It’s important to consult with an accountant or tax specialist if you have any questions about how your World Cup winnings will be taxed in your jurisdiction.

Australia

If you are a resident of Australia and win money from gambling, you will need to declare this as income and pay tax on it. The amount of tax you will pay will depend on how much money you win. If your winnings are $10,000 or less, you will pay 30% tax. If your winnings are more than $10,000, you will pay 45% tax.



Brazil

In Brazil, any gambling winnings are considered taxable income. You will need to declare any such winnings on your annual income tax return and pay the relevant taxes. The amount of tax you pay will depend on how much money you win. If your winnings are equivalent to BRL 3,000 or less, you will pay 15% in taxes. If your winnings are more than BRL 3,000 but less than BRL 30,000, you will pay 25%. If your winnings are more than BRL 30,000, you will pay 35%.



England

In England, gambling profits are generally subject to income tax. However, there is a special “gambling exception” which means that betting profits (up to a certain limit) are not taxable. The limit for this exception is currently set at £1,000 per year. So if your total betting profits for the year amount to £1,001 or more, then all of these profits will be taxable. Any losses can also be offset against other income.

#  Soccer Fans Beware: You Could be taxed up to 45% on any Slot Machine Winnings

TORONTO, ON--(Marketwired - Jun 09, 2017) - The Canadian government is considering a new tax that would levy a 45% tax on all slot machine winnings. The proposed "Hockey Stick Tax" would be applied to all winnings above $10,000, and would bring in an estimated $265 million per year in additional revenue.

The proposed tax has drawn criticism from some soccer fans, who argue that it would unfairly penalize those who enjoy gambling on soccer matches. "This is a blatant cash grab by the government," said one fan. "They're trying to take advantage of people who love sports betting."

Supporters of the tax argue that it is fair and reasonable, given that other forms of gambling are already taxed at a higher rate. "Casinos and lotteries are taxed at around 50%, so this is really just leveling the playing field," said one MP.

The Hockey Stick Tax is expected to be introduced as part of the upcoming budget, and will likely face opposition in the Senate.
