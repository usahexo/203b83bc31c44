#  Trump Taj Mahal Casino Closes Doors After 26 Years In Business

The Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has closed its doors after 26 years in business.

The casino, which was originally opened by Donald Trump in 1990, filed for bankruptcy for the fourth time in 2014 and was taken over by billionaire Carl Icahn. In October of 2016, Icahn announced that he would be closing the casino due to failed negotiations with union workers.

Most of the casino's 3,000 employees were given notice in October that their jobs would be terminated on December 12th. However, union workers continued to negotiate with Icahn in hopes of keeping the casino open. On Sunday, November 13th, those negotiations failed and the casino closed its doors.

Former Trump Taj Mahal employees expressed disappointment at the closure. Many had been with the casino since it opened and had hoped to retire from there. Some employees even staged a protest outside the building on Sunday.

Trump Taj Mahal is one of five casinos to close in Atlantic City since 2014.

#  Atlantic City Gambling Age To Remain At 18 After Trump Taj Mahal Closure

The Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City will close its doors after Labor Day, according to the company’s president. This will leave about 3,000 workers without a job.

The closure of the casino is a major blow to Atlantic City, which is already struggling economically. The Trump Taj Mahal is one of the city’s largest employers.

In response to the closure, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has said that the state’s gambling age will not be raised from 18 to 21. This is good news for young people who enjoy gambling and for the businesses that rely on them.

Raising the gambling age would have been a major blow to Atlantic City’s economy. It would have resulted in the loss of jobs and tax revenue.

The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal is also a reminder that Atlantic City is in serious trouble. The city has been struggling since casinos started moving to other states a few years ago.

Atlantic City officials are hoping that a referendum on November 8th will help revive the city’s economy. The referendum would allow two new casinos to be built in Atlantic City.

#  Fifth Casino Closes in AC, Leaving Thousands Unemployed

The Atlantic City casino industry took another hard hit this week when the fifth casino announced it would be closing its doors. This leaves thousands of employees out of work, just as the Christmas season starts.

The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal is a major blow to both the city and the state of New Jersey. The casino was one of the largest in Atlantic City, and its closure leaves a gaping hole in the city’s economy.

This is the latest in a series of closures that has hit the city hard. In recent years, four other casinos have closed, putting more than 10,000 people out of work.

The closures are a direct result of increased competition from casinos in neighboring states. Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland all have casinos that are siphoning business away from Atlantic City.

Casino supporters had been hoping that a new bill that would allow gambling in North Jersey would help revive the industry. But that bill appears to be stalled in the legislature, and there is no sign that it will be passed anytime soon.

The future looks bleak for Atlantic City’s casino industry. Unless something is done to bolster the industry, more casinos will likely close in the coming years. This will leave thousands more people unemployed and struggling to make ends meet.

#  Future of Gambling Age in Atlantic City Remains Uncertain After Fifth Casino Closure

Atlantic City, long known as the gambling capital of the east coast, is facing an uncertain future after the closure of its fifth casino in less than a year. The closure of the $2.4 billion Revel casino has left nearly 4000 employees out of work and raised questions about the future of gambling in Atlantic City.

Atlantic City's gaming industry has been in decline for years, as consumers have been flocking to casinos in neighboring states. The crumbling casino industry has had a devastating effect on Atlantic City's economy, leading to high unemployment and poverty rates.

The closure of Revel leaves just 8 casinos operating in Atlantic City, and many are worried that more casinos will soon close their doors. This may not be great news for casino operators either, as revenue from gambling is dropping rapidly. In 2013, gambling revenue from Atlantic City's casinos totaled $2.86 billion, down from $3.9 billion in 2007.

So what is the future of gambling in Atlantic City? It remains uncertain. Some experts believe that some smaller casinos may close down in the next few years, while others believe that the industry will stabilize and eventually rebound. However, it is clear that Atlantic City's days as the gambling capital of the east coast are numbered.

Atlantic City's Gambling Age Remains at 18 as Another Casino Closes

Atlantic City's gambling age remains at 18, despite the closure of another casino in the city.

The Atlantic Club casino, which closed its doors on January 13, was the first to close in Atlantic City in over two decades. The casino is just one of the 12 casinos currently open in Atlantic City.

The news of the closure has led some to call for an increase in the gambling age from 18 to 21. However, New Jersey state senator Jim Whelan has said that he does not support such a measure.

"I don't think it would be wise to change the age now," Whelan said. "But we'll have to wait and see what happens."

The closure of The Atlantic Club has already had a negative impact on employment in the area, with over 1,000 employees losing their jobs.
