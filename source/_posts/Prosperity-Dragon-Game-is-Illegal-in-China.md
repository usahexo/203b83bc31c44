#  Prosperity Dragon Game is Illegal in China

Prosperity Dragon is an idle game made by Hyper Hippo Games and it is currently available on the App Store and Google Play. The game has been downloaded more than 10 million times and it has a rating of 4.6 stars on the App Store.

Prosperity Dragon is a simple game where players need to tap on the dragon to earn gold. The gold can then be used to purchase items, such as buildings and decorations. The game also features a unique breeding system, which allows players to breed different dragon combinations in order to create powerful new dragons.

While the game is available in most countries, it is actually illegal in China. The Chinese government has labeled Prosperity Dragon as an “unhealthy game” and it has been banned from being played in China. This isn’t too surprising, as many idle games have been banned in China due to their addictive nature.

Despite the fact that Prosperity Dragon is illegal in China, it is still one of the most popular idle games on the App Store and Google Play. This could be due to its high quality graphics, simple gameplay mechanics, and addictive nature.

#  Prosperity Dragon Game is a Scam

Prosperity Dragon Game is a fraudulent app that has been created with the sole purpose of stealing people’s money. This app promises to help users make money, but in reality it just takes their hard-earned cash.

Prosperity Dragon Game uses deceptive tactics to lure people into signing up for its services. It claims that users can make profits of $10,000 a day just by using the app, but this is simply not true. The only people who make money from Prosperity Dragon Game are the creators of the app, who scam people out of their hard-earned cash.

People should avoid this app at all cost, as it will only result in them losing money. There are plenty of other legitimate apps available that can help users make money, so there is no need to risk your money on Prosperity Dragon Game.

#  Prosperity Dragon Game is Rigged

The Prosperity Dragon game by Plarium is a digital collectible card game (CCG) for Android and iOS devices. In the game, players battle against each other using dragons and magical creatures to earn rewards. Some players have accused the game of being rigged, specifically in regards to the cards that are offered as rewards.

Players have complained that they never seem to get the good cards from battles, while others seem to always win the best cards. This has caused some players to accuse Plarium of rigging the game in order to give an advantage to those who spend money on it. While there is no definitive answer as to whether or not the game is rigged, it does seem suspicious that some players always manage to get the best cards while others struggle.

If you're looking for a fair and balanced CCG, Prosperity Dragon may not be the game for you. If you're willing to take the risk of possibly being ripped off, then you may enjoy this game. Just be aware that there is a possibility that you may not get a fair chance at winning.
