#  How to Create Your Own Bitcoin Casino Fortune Baccarat 2 Game 

Creating your own Bitcoin casino game can be a lot of fun and also very profitable. In this article, we will show you how to create the popular Fortune Baccarat 2 game.

1. First, you will need to create a new Bitcoin casino game by going to the “Casino Games” page on your casino platform and clicking on the “Add Game” button.

2. Next, you will need to give your game a name and description. For our example, we will name the game “Fortune Baccarat 2” and describe it as follows: “This exciting Bitcoin casino game is based on the classic baccarat game. However, in Fortune Baccarat 2, there is an added twist – the player can bet on whether the banker or player will win, or whether there will be a tie. This makes for a more exciting and suspenseful game!”

3. Now you will need to set up the rules of your game. For our example, we will use the following rules: 
- The game is played with 8 decks of cards.
- A player can bet on any of the three outcomes (banker, player, or tie).
- The banker always wins when the player has a tied hand (i.e., player and banker both have a value of 5).
- The payout for a winning bet on the banker is 1:1 minus 5% commission (so a winning bet would pay out 95 cents on the dollar).
- The payout for a winning bet on the player is 1:1 minus 2% commission (so a winning bet would pay out 98 cents on the dollar).
- The payout for a winning bet on a tie is 8:1.
4. Next, you will need to set up the betting limits for your game. We recommend setting them high enough that players feel that they have something to play for but low enough that inexperienced players still have a chance of winning some money. For our example, we will use betting limits of $10 minimum and $100 maximum bets.
5. Finally, you will need to set up the payouts for each possible outcome of your game. You can do this by creating tables like the one below: 

Banker Player Tie 
Pays 1:1 -5% Commission 1:1 -2% Commission 8:1

# Introduction
Bitcoin casinos are on the rise. In fact, statistics show that around half of all Bitcoin transactions now occur in a casino environment. So what better way to get in on this action than to start your own casino?

# 1: Choose Your Bitcoin Casino Software
When it comes to starting your own Bitcoin casino, the first step is to choose your software. There are a few different options out there, but the two most popular ones are CoinGaming and SoftSwiss.

CoinGaming is a fairly new player in the Bitcoin casino space, but they have quickly established themselves as one of the top choices thanks to their easy-to-use platform and wide range of games. SoftSwiss is a little more established, and they offer a more comprehensive package that includes everything from casino management software to payment processing solutions.

# 2: Set Up Your Casino Server
Once you’ve chosen your software, you need to set up your casino server. This will be used to manage all aspects of your casino, from accepting bets and payments to tracking player activity and issuing payouts. Setting up a casino server can be a bit complex, so if you’re not comfortable doing it yourself you can always enlist the help of a professional.

# 3: Get Your Casino License 
Before you can open your doors for business, you’ll need to obtain a gambling license. This process can be a little tricky, but there are plenty of online resources available to help you out. The most important thing is to make sure that your licensing jurisdiction is reputable and that your casino meets all the applicable regulations.

# 4: Market Your Casino 
 Once your casino is up and running, it’s time to start marketing it! There are many different ways to do this, from SEO and social media campaigns to paid advertising . The most important thing is to target your audience correctly and make sure that your branding is consistent across all channels.

#  How to Create and Run a Bitcoin Casino Fortune Baccarat 2 Game 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create and run a Bitcoin casino game called Fortune Baccarat 2. This game is based on the traditional card game baccarat.

First, you will need to create a new empty project in your favorite code editor. You can use any programming language you like for this project, but we will be using JavaScript in this tutorial.

Next, you will need to downloads the Fortune Baccarat 2 source code from Github. You can do this by clicking on the "Clone or download" button and then selecting "Download ZIP".

Once you have downloaded the source code, extract the contents of the ZIP file to a new folder on your computer.

Now it's time to start coding! The first thing you will need to do is include the necessary files and libraries in your project. The source code includes a file called "index.js" that contains all of the code for the game. You can open this file in your code editor to get started.

The first thing you will need to do is define some constants that will be used throughout the game. These constants include different variables such as: the size of the deck, the number of players, and the betting limits: var NUM_OF_PLAYERS = 4; //Number of players var LIMIT_BETTING = 100; // maximum bet amount var CARD_DECK_SIZE = 52; // Size of deck var SEQ_CARD = ["Ace","Two","Three","Four","Five","Six","Seven","Eight","Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]; // Sequence of cards var FACE_CARDS = ["Two","Three","Four","Five","Six","Seven", "Eight","Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]; // Face cards


Next, you will need to create a function that will generate a random number between 0 and 1. This function can be used to determine the results of each game: function rand(max) { return Math.floor(Math.random()*max); }


Next, you will need to define a function that will deal cards to each player: function dealCards(player) { for (var i = 0; i < CARD_DECK_SIZE; ++i) { if (SEQ_CARD[i] === player) { //Deal card break; } } }


 Next, you will need to write the code that checks if a player has won or lost: function checkWinner(player) { if (rand(2) === 1) { //Player wins return true; } else { //Player loses return false; } }



 Finally, you will need to write the main game loop: function run() { while (true) { console.log("=== Deal Cards ==="); dealCards(0); checkWinner(0); console.log("==> Player One Wins!"); setTimeout(run, 1000); } }


The first thing this code does is log a message to the console indicating that it is about to deal cards. It then calls the dealCards() function, which deals cards to each player one at a time. The code then checks who has won and logs this result to the console. If there is no winner, it sets a timeout for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) and then repeats these same steps over again.
