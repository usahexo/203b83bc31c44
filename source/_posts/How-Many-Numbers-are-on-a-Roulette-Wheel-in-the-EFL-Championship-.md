#  roulette wheel has 38 numbers - so what happens when one is ejected?

The roulette wheel is a popular casino game that has 38 numbers in total. One of these numbers is randomly ejected every time the game is played. So what happens just after this number is ejected?

When the roulette ball drops into a numbered slot and comes to a stop, that number becomes the winning number and bets on that number are paid out at odds of 35 to 1. In European roulette, there are 36 possible numbers and in American roulette, there are 38 possible numbers - both of which include the 0 and 00 slots. The 3rd column on either table layout has the following: 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 29, 30. 31.

If the ball drops into one of these slots on the wheel and comes to a stop, it's still counted as being part of that column and players who bet on that column would still win their bets. So what happens when one of these numbers is ejected from the roulette wheel instead? Let's take a look at an example:

In this scenario, let's say that a player has placed a bet on number 17 and the ball drops into number 17 on the wheel. However, before the dealer can announce that this is the winning number; the ball suddenly flies out of the wheel and lands in number 5 on the opposite side of the wheel. What happens to player's bets now?

In this instance because number 17 was not technically called as being the winning number by the dealer; all bets placed on this number would become void and would not be paid out. This also includes any additional bets made on combo bets or split bets which contain number 17 as one of their selections. So if you place a $10 bet on splits consisting of both numbers 5 and 17 for instance - your entire bet would become void if either one or both of those numbers lose.

#  Premier League clubs could soon be playing with an odd number of players after one number was ejected from the roulette wheel

Reports suggest that Premier League clubs are edging closer to playing with an odd number of players, after one was ejected from the roulette wheel.

The change is seen as being necessary to prevent any unfairness in the competition, with clubs previously able tofield a team of 18 players - two more than their opponents.

While some die-hard fans may not be happy about the prospect of their club having to play with an odd number of players, officials believe that the change will ultimately benefit the competitive nature of the division.
