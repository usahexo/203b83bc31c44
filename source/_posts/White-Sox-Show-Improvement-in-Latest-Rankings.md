#  White Sox Move Up One Spot in MLB Power Rankings

The Chicago White Sox have had a pretty good season so far, and it has shown in their position in the MLB power rankings. They started off the year at number six, but have since moved up to number five. This is a great spot for them, as they continue to compete in the tough American League Central division.

There are a few teams ahead of them that they will need to overtake in order to make it to the playoffs, but it is definitely not impossible. The Cleveland Indians are currently in first place, but the White Sox are just four games back. They will need to continue playing well if they want to catch up and take over the top spot.

In addition to their division rivals, the Detroit Tigers and Minnesota Twins, they will also need to watch out for teams like the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels. Both of these squads are currently ahead of the White Sox in the standings, so they will need to start picking up some wins if they want to move up further in the rankings.

There are still plenty of games left to be played this season, so anything is possible. If the White Sox can keep up their strong play, they could very well end up at the top of the list by the end of the year.
