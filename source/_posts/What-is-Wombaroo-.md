#  What is the Wombaroo Game? 

Developed in Australia, the Wombaroo Game is a fun and challenging puzzle game that is loved by people of all ages. The object of the game is to remove all of the wombaroo’s babies from the game board using only the given tools. 

The game can be played by two or more players, and each player is given a set of different-colored wombaroos and wooden tools. The game board is made up of a 16x16 grid, with four babies located in each corner. The aim of the game is to remove all of the babies from the board, and the player who does so first wins. 

Babies can only be removed if they are surrounded by four other wombaroos of the same color, and players can use either the wood or metal tools to remove them. If a player uses a tool to remove a baby and it lands on another baby, that baby is also removed from the board.

#  What is the history of Wombaroo?

The Wombaroo company was founded in 2001 by Dr. Ben Elazari and his wife, Romi. The couple had always been interested in breeding animals and working with them, so they decided to create their own business breeding and raising baby animals.

Initially, they focused on raising kangaroos, but soon expanded to other marsupials like quokkas and wallabies. They also started breeding and raising birds, including emus and cassowaries.

Dr. Ben Elazari is a veterinarian with over 25 years of experience in the field. He has always been passionate about helping animals, so he was keen to start his own business and share his knowledge with others.

Wombaroo quickly became popular with locals and tourists alike, thanks to its educational tours of the facility and its wide variety of baby animals. The company continued expanding over the years, eventually opening a second location near Cairns.

Today, Wombaroo is one of the largest animal breeding companies in Australia, offering visitors a unique experience that can’t be found anywhere else.
