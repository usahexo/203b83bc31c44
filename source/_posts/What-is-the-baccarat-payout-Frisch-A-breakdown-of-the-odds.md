#  How to calculate the payout for a baccarat game with Frisch

This document will explain how to calculate the payout for a baccarat game with Frisch. The first step is to determine the player's and banker's bets. We'll assume that the player has bet $10 on the player, and the banker has bet $10 on the banker. The second step is to calculate the expected value of each bet. We'll assume that both the player and banker have a 50% chance of winning. The expected value of the player's bet is 0 * 0.5 + 10 * 0.5 = 5, and the expected value of the banker's bet is -10 * 0.5 + 10 * 0.5 = 0.

The third step is to calculate the payout for each bet. The payout for a winning player's bet is $10, and the payout for a winning banker's bet is $11. The payout for a losing player's bet is -$1, and the payout for a losing banker's bet is -$0.50.

The final step is to calculate the net win or loss for each side. The net win for the player is 5 - 1 = 4, and the net win for the banker is 0 - 0 = 0.
