#  Literary Great Allen Poe Goes Bankrupt After First Gambling Incident

Author and poet, Allen Poe, went bankrupt after his first known gambling incident. The bankruptcy filing happened in 1827, two years after Poe's first known gambling episode.

The public records show that Poe had liabilities of $1,584.76 and assets of only $96.97. This would have been a significant amount of money at the time, especially for someone who was not well-known.

There is no indication as to how Poe managed to squander such a large sum of money or where the money actually went. However, given that this was Poe's first known foray into gambling, it is likely that he lost a great deal of money in a short period of time.

Interestingly, this was also around the same time that Poe's writing career was taking off. He had published several pieces in magazines and journals and was starting to gain attention from the literary elite. It is possible that he spent more money than he could afford in an effort to promote his work or maintain his lifestyle.

Whatever the reason may be, it is clear that Poe's first gambling experience was not a successful one. This incident would go on to have a significant impact on his personal life and career trajectory.

#  Unemployed and In Debt, Allen Poe Turns to Gambling for Relief

Allen Poe hit a low point in his life when he was laid off from his job of 30 years and found that he owed more than $60,000 in debt. He struggled to find other work in a sluggish economy and soon found himself turning to gambling as a way to make ends meet.

At first, Allen's gambling was relatively innocuous - he would bet on sports games or play the occasional slots game. However, as his debts mounted, Allen began placing bigger and bigger bets in order to try and win back what he had lost. This soon led to a habit of gambling that was spiraling out of control.

Allen's wife and children were concerned about their father's behavior, but he refused to listen to their warnings. He told them that he could handle his gambling and that it wasn't a big deal. In reality, Allen was just trying to hold onto his false sense of control.

As his debts continued to grow, Allen became more and more desperate. He would stay up all night gambling online and then spend the days looking for new ways to make money. His health started to suffer as a result of all the stress and anxiety that accompanied his gambling addiction.

Finally, Allen's family staged an intervention and got him into treatment for his addiction. It was only after getting help that Allen was able to see how much damage he had done to himself and his family. He is now on the road to recovery and working towards repairing the damage that he has caused.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help immediately. Gambling can be extremely addictive and can ruin your life if left unchecked. There are many resources available for those who need help, so don't hesitate to ask for assistance.

#  Allen Poe's Addiction to Gambling Costs Him His Home and Fortune

Legendary American author, Allen Poe, was known for his dark and macabre writing, as well as his addiction to gambling. Many believe that it was this addiction that led to his ruin. In 1837, Poe lost his home and most of his possessions after a night of gambling at a casino in Baltimore. To make matters worse, he extremely in debt to numerous creditors.

It is documented that Poe continued to gamble heavily throughout the 1840s, losing tens of thousands of dollars in the process. This eventually led to him filing for bankruptcy in 1849. In a letter written shortly before his death, Poe lamented his tragic life, stating "In the ardor of pursuit, I have squandered my property . . . my health is greatly impaired . . . my reputation is gone." It is truly tragic that such a talented writer was brought down by his addiction to gambling.

#  Famous Author Allen Poe Rams Through Poverty Barrier After Gambling Debts

Famous author, Allen Poe, was born in 1809 to a David Poe Jr. and Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe. The family was moderately well off until 1811 when David Poe Sr., Allan's grandfather, lost a large sum of money in a bad investment. This caused the family to fall into poverty and forced Edgar, Allan's father, to leave home and join the military. To make matters worse, Allan's mother died in 1811 from tuberculosis. Allan was then taken into the home of John and Frances Allan who were childless.

The Allans were not able to completely erase Allan's past and he continued to struggle with poverty his entire life. In 1826, Allan would enter the University of Virginia but because of his lack of funds, had to leave after one year. He would then move to Boston where he started working as an editor for a magazine. While in Boston, Poe met Charles Dickens who highly recommended that he start writing fiction. And so he did.

Many famous works including "The Raven" and "The Pit and the Pendulum" were published during his lifetime but unfortunately, he never saw much monetary success from his writing. In fact, he often resorted to gambling in order to make ends meet. It was during one such instance that he ran up quite a debt at a gaming table and was subsequently forced to flee town. He would later find himself penniless in Baltimore where he died at the age of 40 under mysterious circumstances.

Even though Allan Poe faced many hardships throughout his life, he persevered and is today considered one of the most influential authors in American history.

#  Bankruptcy Proceedings Filed Against Author Allen Poe After Failed Gambling Venture

On January 15th, 2019, author Allen Poe filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The decision came after a failed investment in a casino venture in Atlantic City. Documents filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey show that Poe owes $1.4 million to more than two dozen creditors.

The assets listed in Poe’s bankruptcy filing are modest, totaling just over $38,000. Included in that amount is a $32,000 home in Pittsburgh and a 2006 Ford Focus with approximately 78,000 miles on it.

Poe’s largest creditor is the United States government, which is owed more than $827,000 in taxes. Other major debtors include the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue ($115,000), PNC Bank ($108,000), and Warner Bros. Entertainment ($103,000).

In a statement released to the press, Poe said he was “devastated” by the failure of his gambling venture but felt “forced” to file for bankruptcy given the scale of his debts. He vowed to repay his creditors “to the best of my ability” and expressed hope that he could still “write great books that people will love.”

This is not Poe’s first brush with financial trouble. In 2015, he declared personal bankruptcy after racking up more than $700,000 in debt from credit card purchases and home renovations.

Poe is best known for his short stories and poems, including “The Tell-Tale Heart” and “The Raven.” He has published numerous books over the course of his career and won several awards, including the Edgar Award for Best Novel in 2014 for his work “The Silkworm.”
