#  How to Follow a Baccarat Screen in the EFL Championship 

In last year’s English Football League Championship (EFL Championship), parachute payments, which are financial assistance payments to clubs that are relegated from the Premier League, played a major role in club spending. These payments totaled 166 million pounds and were given to the four clubs that were relegated from the Premier League in the 2016-2017 season. Out of the 166 million pounds, Aston Villa received the most at 47.5 million pounds.

Due to these payments, Championship clubs are able to spend more on players in order to improve their teams and compete for promotion to the Premier League. This increase in spending has resulted in a number of high-profile signings this summer, including Joe Cole joining Aston Villa and John Terry signing for Aston Villa’s rivals Birmingham City.

One of the most intriguing games of the upcoming season is going to be when Aston Villa hosts Birmingham City on October 14th. The game will be a clash of two of the biggest spending clubs in the Championship and should be a great matchup.
